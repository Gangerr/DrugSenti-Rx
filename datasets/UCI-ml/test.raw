I've tried a few antidepressants over the years, but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia, anxiety and then my doctor suggested and changed me onto $T$ and this medicine has saved my life.

Using $T$ on arms and face. Put vaseline on lips, under eyes and in nostrils to protect from cream.  So far no reaction at all.  I know I have many pre cancer and thought I would light up like a Christmas tree but so far so good. Maybe it's coming but time will tell.

So I was on $T$ for about 3 months and after 2 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it and It also made my period weird I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next

I've been on $T$ for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn't go away no matter what I took. I'm still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better. I take 10mg at night.

I was on $T$ for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn't make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week.

Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking $T$ for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CANT PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. I just decided to wean myself off $T$ and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don't need this drug- DON'T START. Seriously.

I absolutely love $T$ and recommend to everyone. I know everyones body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.

$T$ wasn't too bad!  I had a hard time with the first dose as I'm not used to very sugary drinks and such.  Because of this, I did think it tasted quite gross.  It had a strange grape salty flavor but it was only 16 oz, so it wasn't too bad to get down.  I had absolutely no discomfort or nausea.  It worked very fast and I was completely clean for the colonoscopy - this was my first colonoscopy and after having read the awful reviews of the gallon jug prep, I went for this stuff.

my advice on $T$ is understand that it is an opioid blocker in the same manner that naloxone (found in suboxone) is an opioid blocker. My husband took 12.5mg and was thrown in withdrawal. Nausea first, chills, fever, shaking so hard the bed was vibrating. I thought $T$ worked on the backed up but it stops the opioid from working. Of course you will have diarrhea when your pain meds are cut off.

I have been administering $T$ now for 2 1/2 months, with absolutely no reduction of abdominal fat. I am a thin person with my abdominal fat causing me to be unable to close my buttons and zippers of my clothing. Then I heard of $T$ thinking it was the answer. Wrong! No results, just a painful irritated, scar tissue in my abdomen now.

I started taking $T$ experimentally to treat chronic depression and am now prescribed 1800mg a day.  At doses of 2700mg I experienced a significant improvement in impulse control and depression in general.  Went from being a shut in, to going for walks and enjoying my time in the company of others.  At the lower dose of 1800mg a day, I don't experience much improvement, save for a decrease in depressive symptoms.  I'm looking forward to a larger dose if my doctor okays it.

Im absolutely DONE taking this horrible birth control! I've been taking $T$ for a month and a half... I'm moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it's STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I'm not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive!

I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. $T$ has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven't had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!

About two months ago I had to switch from LoLestrin Fe to $T$ due to my insurance and pharmacy. Since starting $T$ I've noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge. After one month of it I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class. I've also noticed I've developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense. My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore. I'm done with it!

I'm getting it removed tomorrow and I most likely am going to have to be in therapy.

I started off by taking regular Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.  After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking $T$ for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!

I have been taking $T$ for a month for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. I had been getting up to urinate 2 or 3 times a night, suffering from severe pain during urination. Since starting Flomax I have found  myself dizzy if getting up quickly, blurred vision, decreased sex drive with abnormal ejaculate. I have lower back pain. I feel weaker and tired all the time. On the up side I can go all night with no need to get up to urinate and the pain while urinating is 50 percent less.

Yes, this medication does work wonders.  Diagnosed ADHD (by a Psychiatrist)  at the age of 26.  The first 3 years it worked quite well and felt like a godsend.  I took 5-6 days a week and my life demonstratively improved.  Focus, completing tasks, mental clarity, improved self-esteem...life is good.

I recently took $T$ and honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I'm so happy I went through with it!!! Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I've never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice!

I used $T$ and within 6 hours my eyes swelled almost shut, and cheeks puffed up. 2 weeks later I still have red watery eyes, but thankfully the swelling is finally gone. I will never use this product again (obviously), but it is also incredibly expensive. I have never had an allergic reaction to any medication before so this was very unexpected.

I was prescribed $T$ for onset of anxiety and possible hormonal mood swings. I was not told by my doctor how it would make me feel or how hard coming off of it would be. I took one 37.5 mg capsule and was horrified that I was given this. I woke up at 2am with an anxiety attack for about the first hour. It then went into being wired, nauseous, shakey, weak, chills and sweating. I never took another dose! And even one pill took at least another full day to leave my system. My nervous system is obviously sensitive and I could not handle this medication at all.

I started $T$ this morning. About 4 hours later the rare side effects kicked in. Heart palpitations, dizziness, headache, and I was FREEZING. Even at 43 I still call my mommy. She wasn't thrilled I was going to take it anyway since I have perfect blood pressure. But she recommended laying on my left side. That did help even if it did take awhile for me to get warm again. The headache is still lingering.

Since I was on the trials I put 6+ months but I have been back on $T$ for about 2 weeks.  $T$ is nothing short of a miracle. I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly. This allows me to manage my glucose in real time without babysitting diabetes all day.

$T$ did not help me at all.  I was on it for about 3 months, worked up to 100mg.  I was tired and hungry all the time.  I gained 20 lbs and slept all day. I was a complete zombie.  Definitely made my depression worse.

I was prescribed $T$ for a kidney infection. I took two doses, 500 mgs each. After the first dose, I began to feel lousy. I assumed it was a side effect. The second dose almost killed me. I went to the ER, where I was stabilized enough to move me to ICU. Before I lost consciousness, my blood pressure was 35/27. I woke up 3 days later with a central line, severely swollen body, and my skin was bright red, like a severe sunburn. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, with my blood pressure constantly plummeting. I apparently have a severe allergy.

In my mid 30's, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn't seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on $T$ and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn't afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.  Thank you $T$!

So in high school over ten years ago I started to sweat really bad under my arms. It was super embarrassing to go through high school with this issue. After trying over the counter products and home remedies I gave up. So my Dr at the time recommended $T$. I used it for just a few weeks and it worked so good. But then after a few months I noticed my armpits darkening. So I stopped using it. This stuff did 100% cure my sweaty armpits and I can now freely wear shirts without the sweat marks. But it burned me so bad that I have dark scars for life and still can't walk around freely with tank tops.

I had $T$ for a year and a half and had cramping the whole time with terrible long heavy periods.  The last couple months I had it I was in so much pain I could hardly walk. Went to my doc and she said nothing seemed wrong.  Then the next day I went to the ER and had it removed. It had slipped a little and was causing a lot of discomfort. I will never get an IUD again.

I just started taking this birth control $T$ about 12 days ago when I started my period, and I'm still bleeding as if I'm still on my period. The flow is light however the length of my average period is 2 weeks when I wasn't on birth control. So maybe the medication is altering my system do feel nauseous and I crave like crazy. I do feel a little depressed because my period isn't gone yet but overall it seems to be a good birth control so far.

I have severe scar tissue and adhesions from mutiple surgeries and the pain was intense it is in my pelvic area. I fill like I'm having a bad cycle every day and walking intensifies the pain this is a every day feeling. My doctor tried me on $T$ and it has been a God send. I take it three times a day. Without it it would be hard to walk so I give it a 10 thank you.

Sleep great and the only side effect is an occassional dizziness. Tell everyone you know struggling.

I took $T$ for the first and last time yesterday around 7:41 am . At first I couldn't feel my arms or face and then it felt like fire works were going off in my head . I yawned all day long and each time I did I felt like my own tongue was gagging me . The worst of it was around 3:45 am I woke up shaking uncontrollably falling over couldn't see straight it felt like I was being electrocuted it was to the point I either wanted to be knocked out or die . My husband found me shaking and rocking back and forth in our living room floor . This drug for me personally was horrific.

Had unprotected sex near my ovulation date and freaked out so I went to go get the $T$ pill. I was really nauseous on and off, had headaches and was dizzy. I was REALLY tired too. My period came two weeks earlier and it was really bad. Had big blood clots, really heavy period. The cramps were terrible. It was an unpleasant experience. BUT no baby. So that's good. Really helped.

I did not like this medication $T$. For anxiety, I have also tried Hydroxyzine (Atarax). I guess this is just my personal body chemistry but I actually prefer Atarax to this unlike most people. $T$ made me VERY lightheaded and dizzy. I can't exactly remember the effect it had on anxiety, I think it may have helped a little.

I'm on the second implant of $T$. The first was brilliant had hardly any periods, just a tiny bit of spotting. A year ago I had my first removed after 3 attempts at finding it, it was eventually removed after a scan. The second one has been completely different. After about 6 months I've started having light periods or spotting which hasn't ceased in the last 2 months. If no improvement I may consider removal.

$T$ is by far the best thing on the market for motion sickness. My husbands first love is the ocean so I have had to find something that helps me function on the water.  I take it the night before and only have to take 1/2 the morning of our crossing to Catalina.  It really works.  A sail boater told me about this medicine 20 years ago. The only problem, it's hard to find.  More people should know about this medicine.

This is the third day I've had $T$ and so far my experience has been excellent. I'd suggest taking ibuprofen all throughout the day and put a heating pad on your stomach (what i did). The procedure was uncomfortable and painful (i cried) but so far, extremely worth it. The day after I got it the bleeding significantly reduced, and today it's hardly bleeding. First day was the worst but definitely doable. As far as being emotional. The first day I was very irritable but I'm assuming it was because I was hurting and hungry all day. Other than that I've been great!

I have been prescribed $T$ for over a year due to chronic headaches from a severe sinus problem.  They work great.  However you have to be careful.  You will build a tolerance over time and need more of them to have the same analgesic effect. Secondly they are habit forming. If you are on them for a long time and need to use them often, as I have, you will most likely become addicted.

I will say this about $T$. It work for me. Were there side effects? yes. A small bit of bruising and a small rash. I was willing to put up with those side effects because I did not have one craving for a cigarette. I was very happy with the program and have remained smoke free for three years boxing day passed.

I have Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and anxiety, I have never felt more calm and in-control of my emotions. Usually every night I'd fall into a fit of thinking of self-harm, I have thought of them no more, I still get sad, but it's sadness, not full on depression. My anxiety has decreased so much, I still get nervous, but it is not even close to how bad it was. An added bonus, is for me, it makes me drowsy, so I get more sleep. I have never been so happy in my life. $T$ is a life saver.

I've been on $T$ for two months now and my doctor had told me that if I wanted to skip my period I could just skip over the white and jump right into the next pack. So after deciding to do so I've been bleeding for the past week now unexpectedly throughout the day. I have never had acne before but now that I've been on $T$ my forehead has been spotting. Also my breasts have become larger I believe but sore to touch almost everyday. I have gained about 10lbs from it, and my sex drive is gone about halfway through activity. And I've also been feeling bloated. I'm not totally  satisfied with the product but not totally dissatisfied since it obviously works. Debating going off it though.

Love $T$. Went on it and cleared my skin, but I didn't know that $T$ was clearing it I thought it was just the fact I was no longer a teenager. Stopped taking this pill to get an implant to avoid periods. Well, it was hell, acne came back full blown and periods were relentless. Went back to the doctor today and got $T$ again! So excited for clear skin again!

I was on $T$ for about 2 months and it was an awful experience. I started out on 25mg and I couldn't really feel any emotions, so they increased the dosage to 50mg. I started feeling worse, so I was told to increase the dosage again. Once I got to 75mg, I started becoming angry, even more anxious than I was before, I had an out-of-body experience, and I was becoming incredibly impulsive. After trying another anti-depressant and failing, it is believed that I have a mood disorder and was placed on mood stabilizers.

I lost my sexuality from $T$, overnight it went from 100% to 0%. Was told it was a common sideeffect, so I continued using $T$ after a while I didn't want those sideeffect so I stopped using. But my loss of ibido and ED continued. Now 3-4 years later my problems is still the same, doctors refuse to belive me, but I'm certain, I had very high sex drive before my first $T$ pill. No I can't keep my erection more than 5 seconds and my penis often feels numb. This pill should have been illegal!

When I asked my doctor to switch initially, she suggested I wait several months, as sometimes these effects subside, but mine have not.

I just finished my first month of $T$, and I had absolutely no side effects. I have not seen significant weight gain or terrible acne. In fact, I think this medication has actually reduced my acne! My skins clear and smooth, and I don't have painful heavy periods anymore. I think it's worth giving this medication a try!

So I've been on this birth control for about three months. After about three weeks that was gone and it was awesome. No babies. Easy periods almost no cramps it was too good to be true. Now here I am three months into the pill and I've hit a horrible depression. I've never been depressed. But everyday I cry and get so sad I can't go out and I don't want to eat or do anything.

Only the $T$ works for me.  Luckily my medical insurance agreed with my doctor and authorized me to continue getting it. I have found it to be very effective.  An Interesting good side effect is it helps with my serious face pain. A win win medicine!

The insertion of $T$ was the most pain I've ever felt in my life I almost passed out. For the first 3 months I bled everyday and had pretty bad cramps. I am at month 6 now and the cramps are maybe a few times a month. I still spot but its very light and I am not getting my period anymore. It had also helped with the endometriosis. Overall i am satisfied.

I switched to $T$ from Aviane in hopes of clearing up my acne. My experience was far from a miracle. My skin did not clear up AT ALL, and got worse. I'm a freaking irrational hothead all month. I'm usually very good at shrugging off the small stuff, but it's like I have absolutely no control over my emotions anymore. I've become very lethargic; I could sleep all day if you'd let me. My once raging sex drive is now hardly existent.

Started taking $T$ 1 week ago. I wish I read the earlier reviews to prepare myself. Oh my goodness $T$ itches quite a bit,  is that seriously wrong?  Cause I know hydrogen peroxide itches and burns when it's cleaning a cut maybe that's the same thing.... I havent tried the itch cream that comes with it but thats for external use and the itching is internal with warnings on the box not to scratch. Gonna be a rough night.

I was essentially mis-prescribed Actiq when I should have been getting $T$ patches for my cancer pain.  This caused problems with both bolus dosing and build-up of opioid tolerance with the Actiq that have not been nearly as great a problem with $T$ patches.Other patients may have different experiences; however for chronic cancer pain, the patches might be considered before use of Actiq.

I have been a long term sufferer of chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, DDD, Scoliosis, Sciatica, Arthritis, Migraines and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for a long time. After starting out with the over the counter meds, then moving to prescription Motrin, Day trip, Rendering, and numerous anti depressants, my doctor began prescribing $T$. At first they worked, but after 3months, it stopped working.

I had been a bad binge drinker for the last nine years. Going on benders ranging from 5 days to at worse 2 and a half weeks. I could remain abstinent for anything from 1 month to 8 months but always relapsed eventually. 4 hospital detoxes, countless home ones and very ill heavy drinking. Had a warning that my liver had early stage of chirrosiss so that scared me enough to try $T$ 6 a day, been on it a month now complete abstinence and generally feel, marvelous with no cravings or thoughts. So far so good. I'm sleeping great and feel calm and more balanced.

I was given $T$ for pain in the ER about (3)days ago for terrible menstrual cramps and I can say it is definitely a 10 for pain, but the side effects are not the best. I have been drowsy, thirsty, and still a little dizzy, but I guess it depends on the individual.

Have taken $T$ 30mg daily since mid July. Up until this week I have been very pleased at how effectively it has stopped my binge eating. However this week it has prevented me from sleeping at night for 4 nights straight. Scary. Not sure how to stop taking it safely.

The first 3 years I was on $T$ I had no problems, It worked really well and then after that everything was fine. After the 3 years were up I decided to get another one inserted since I had no major problems with the first one. That's when it went downhill. I gained about 22 pounds, became anxious about everything, moods began to change.

Back when I started this pill $T$ ,it actually worked.I've been on it for 6 months now and sure, no babies. That part was effective.But eventually, I ended up having cramps again (they had gone away when i first started) my acne flared up like nobody's buisness, my headaches are horrible and daily.

I have been using this method of Birth Control for over ten years now, I am hesitant to change to another form. I have not had a period since starting $T$ and never had a pregnancy scare. I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise! I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant. Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control.

Been taking this medication $T$ for 6 years. I have a good stream and it was prescribed by my doctor because I wasn't emptying my bladder fully due to a bladder that did not have the muscle tone that it once had. It worked great for most of these years but due to my age, 85, I can't always make it to the bathroom fast enough to urinate.

$T$ causes persistent nausea in some users as per their website. For most people it goes away after a few weeks--but not all. Initially I was also itchy and a little weepy. I will have to switch as I don't want to be chained to zofran. Otherwise, worked fine as an alternative to paxil.

I take $T$ and I have noticed a marked frequency of urination and polyuria after starting this medication.  My doctor suspected a urinary tract infection.  Urinalysis was negative, prostate exam was negative, cystoscopy was negative. The medicine is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but having to urinate every two hours around the clock is certainly interfering with my sleep.  I did find a reference on Drugs.com that said increased urination was a rarely encountered side effect of this drug, but my doctors insist it doesn't have that side effect and I have spent a fortune ruling out other conditions.

Woke up in the middle of the night with a horrendous cough.  I decided to take the some cough medicine and went back to sleep. $T$ stopped the cough.

This medicine $T$ is amazing. After suffering from pretty bad acne and trying every topical product out there, I had pretty much given up all hope of clear skin. I started $T$ and saw no immediate results, but kept applying every night. A month later, my acne was significantly reduced. Two months later... I only have two small pimples that are in the stage of drying up. I highly recommend Ziana!

I was prescribed $T$ for tension headaches. I have severe migraines and tension headaches. They could not find out exactly why I was having them, so we have to treat the symptom. $T$ actually makes me able to function through some of the worst tension headaches. Before, I was spending so much time locked in a dark room between the migraines and tension headaches. I was missing my life and the lives of my children. It is really nice to be able to have a part in their lives and my own. I am thankful daily that I can rejoin the world again.

I am currently on 50mg of $T$ in addition to other meds. It has certainly made a huge positive difference in my paranoid thinking and obsessive-compulsive spartanism. It has leveled out my wild swings between anxiety and depression somewhat. It works great on my insomnia too. It causes me constipation and aggravates my essential tremor, but its benefits are well worth the price.

Got $T$ inserted about a month ago a few days after my last period. The insertion was uncomfortable but not bad at all. It totally works. Started my period last week and it's just been light, almost like spotting as I usually have a 5/6 day period but I'm now going into day 8. Hoping the spotting stops soon so I can stop wearing pads.

My doctor suggested that I take birth control so I decided to try out the pills first. She prescribed me $T$ and I took it for about 3 months before I decided to throw them away. My acne became really horrible! I had never had cystic acne in my life. My skin has still not cleared up which is a real bummer and I'm pretty sure I'm going to remain with scars. Overall it did its job at preventing pregnancy. My period spotted for a few days the first month and I didn't have a period the remaining months.

$T$ honestly helps a lot for my nerve pain, I get it super bad in my arms and It helps so much. I only notice the pain if I don't take it. I take right now 900 ml. I would be in so much more pain without this. Its a blessing. Also I for some reason never get tired from this. I never get tired or anything and can take it in the morning if I forget. It does nothing for my insomnia. Idk if I have a rare reaction to it or what, but my doctor finds it funny. Ha ha!

I just got $T$ not too long ago. And it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. There was not excruciating pain at all. Just cramping. Anyone wanting to get it should most definitely do so. It's not as bad as some may say, but everyone reacts to things differently.

Had $T$ for IVF egg collection.  I was so anxious reading that sedation you can be awake and it Can be painful. Boy was I wrong.  I was under for 10 mins and woke up as though I have had the best sleep in the world no dreams, nada. I woke up feeling amazing.  I had the equivalent of 2 paracetamol whilst under and have needed no other pain relief since the procedure. I feel better than I have felt in a very long time.  I think propaganda must have some really good anti anxiotic purpose for sure. I am now 24 hrs past procedure and still feel fab. Wonderful stuff!!!

My dad always raved about how wonderful $T$ is for speech anxiety and I am finishing up my bachelors degree.. Needless to say I put my Public Speaking course until my last semester.. I took 20mgs an hour before my speech and did I nail it!! I wasn't nervous at all.. And I usually feel like I'm going to puke before a presentation! This is a miracle for me and I will definitely take it again for speeches later on! Would highly recommend to anyone with stage fright or fearful of talking in front of others!

I highly recommend using the gel!

Took $T$ for pneumonia and cleared up quick. Within 2 months my achilles was sore everyday. Made an appointment with a podiatrist for Nov 17th. Achilles snapped on Nov 14th. Surgery went well to repair shredded achilles. In cast for 3 months. Since sore after 3 months on my feet and working. I nurse it everyday. Avoid this drug, if possible. Not worth the side effects.

It's been just over a month of using $T$ and having my final check up soon. So happy with the results honestly. I feel so much more confident and happy it was worth every side effect. for the first time in 8 years I now can go out of the house without makeup on. And I'm not exaggerating. I'm so happy and I honestly think anyone with bad skin should try this honestly it's so worth it!

I've been on $T$ for a few months now, for major depression/anxiety. The $T$ is working well for me. I have more good days. I don't feel sedated, just more positive and functional. As far as side effects, I get an upset stomach if I don't eat before I take it. I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. Overall, it's effective for me, but I have to be more careful to avoid side effects.

I went on this med $T$ last year for PMDD, like severe PMS, and did fine the first 6 months. I'm not sure why, but suddenly my periods are 2 weeks long instead of one. I'm also having the same severity, if not more, of cramps that I had before I started. It has made my mood issues improve, though. I don't feel nearly as depressed as I did before taking it.

I had been suffering from severe constipation that couldn't be cured even with laxatives for 2 weeks until my doctor recommended $T$. I took it with no real progress for 3 days, but on the 4th day I finally started having normal bowel movements! I did not experience any side effects whatsoever as you do with laxatives. (No diarrhea, gas, bloating, sudden urgency, etc.). I finally had complete relief! I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from constipation!

$T$ is a very effective medicine for people such as myself that suffer from debilitating panic disorder and/or PTSD.  This medicine saved me from becoming institutionalized after returning home from the Gulf War back in 1991.  When I first took the medicine, I felt as if I had awoken from a hellish nightmare.  It served me quite well for nearly 20 years because I NEVER abused this medicine.

I was on $T$ for about 2 months, I really noticed the loss of appetite and lost my sweet tooth. My weight came down and my blood sugar levels dropped from 8.5 to 6. I was really happy with the medicine as it works fine until the known side effects started to show. They were nausea this happened approx once a week in the fourth week in on taking the medicine and bloating, indigestion, a lot of passing wind and acidy burps.

I take $T$ for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and $T$ helps to quiet it.

$T$ is very effective. Sometimes, I only take half of one. Just remember to stop taking it about 6 hours before bedtime. Cheaper than energy drinks loaded with sugar. Easier on my tummy than coffee and it doesn't stain my teeth like colas. $T$ is a diuretic so drink plenty of water to make you feel better all day.

I've suffered with Menieres/vestibular neuritis for over 37 years and it has cast a dark shadow over my quality of life.

I am 69 years old.  Prior to starting  5 pumps daily of $T$ 5 months ago, low energy and almost no sex drive plus often could not maintain an erection.  After only a couple of weeks, there was a big turnaround, good erections and libido what it was at age 40. Did notice I was a bit more aggressive.  Then, about the 3rd month things went downhill with things back pretty much as they were before. Got a mix feeling!

Horrible side effects! Doc switched me to $T$ claiming it was very similar to Pristiq, and available in a generic, however I had the WORST insomnia at night. Trouble falling and staying asleep at night- would wake up every hour with mind racing. Dry mouth throughout the day no matter how much water I drank. Also, very fidgety feet and legs while sitting or laying in bed. I was exhausted all day everyday, yet continued waking up several times throughout the night. Went back to my doc, and switched back to Pristiq.

I'm hoping this will wear off soon as it can get in the way of things but I still have a long way to go so hopefully it will all work out for the best.

I switched to $T$ from Sprintec birth control and it's been nothing but hell. I don't know if it's my body thats reacting so negatively or what but I hate this birth control. It hasn't even been a full month and I'm already on the urge of losing my mind. I've been crying almost everyday, snapping at people feeling depressed and hated..it's unreal. I've never been so sad in my life. My headache also gotten much worse than before.

I'm going to continue to take it as long as I keep seeing the weight drop. It's not going to make you drop 10 lbs a week. You also have to be in the right mindset to be ready to eat better also.

I have taken $T$ for about 4 to 5 years now.  I started on the dose pack and first leveled out at 1mg.  I found if I took 2 1mg tablets I would dry heave.

I am only 42 yrs old and fear being crippled due to this nasty disease.  I am hoping this medicine will continue to work for me.  Hydrocodone 5-325 just wasn't cutting it for me anymore, needed something stronger as the pain was getting truly unbearable.  I would recommend others to try it.  I've read a lot of reviews and have seen mixed reviews but for the most part others are happy with the results like myself.

I have interstitial cystitis have taken $T$ on three separate occasions (1-4 days at a time) and it only helped once.  My bladder felt painfully full even immediately after urinating and it helped  the second time I took it for a few days before my bladder calmed down.  The other two times it did nothing.  Very similar symptoms but no relief.

$T$ is pretty much ineffective for me.  I lay in bed for over an hour trying to sleep and if I do happen to fall asleep I wake up many times throughout the night.  I guess I need something stronger.

I was diagnosed with stage 4 Leiomyosarcoma 7/16/2013. Tumors in my stomach, liver, and a few affected lymph nodes. Had surgery and removed 40% of my stomach on 8/30/13. Surgery was a success. I Underwent 4 1/2 months of chemo with minimal shrinkage to existing tumors but did stunt the growth of the tumors. At that point my tumors were considered inoperable. Started $T$  2/14, just found out my tumors have shrunk enough on my liver to be operable. Liver Surgery scheduled 10/14. So happy, praying $T$ is our miracle. Good luck to others with my condition.

After getting my 2nd $T$, I've had the worst 4 months of my life!!  Within a couple weeks, I went from a very young 70 yr old to a 90 year old woman.  My back and hips have been so painful, that I have to wear a stiff back support to be able to move.  Even with this, I can't stand up straight. I am awakened at night because of the pain and I can't turn over in bed.  I am constantly achey and tired.  Before Prolia, I was extremely active.  I worked with a personal trainer twice a week for six months, before the 2nd injection, but now, I have probably lost all the muscle, strength and flexibility I gained. $T$ is the worst!!!!!

I started to get anxiety and panic attacks when I was 24. I am now 30. I have tried multiple of medication for anxiety, bi-polar,depression etc... I was getting the racing thoughts but worst of all was the womp feeling you get it's hard to explain. Trust me it sucks i still get crazy but on $T$ it really helped me I only take $T$ nothing else. You name it I was on it schizophrenia meds as well. I understand when people say I can't get up I can't go out. Just try it all are different!

Before switching to $T$, I never had an ovarian cyst before. After starting $T$ about 4 months ago, I wound up in the hospital 3 times for severe abdominal pain which turned out to be ovarian cysts. For everything else, this birth control is great and I have no complaints. But the cysts gotta go, so do these pills.

Hi everyone! I started taking $T$ 10 days and have already lost about 8 pounds. The first night I was very nauseous, but it hasn't been as bad. My appetite has become virtually non existent. I eat maybe a forth of what I used to eat, but I'm loving the results already. I've been on Metformin for almost 10 years and it's never done what this medication has. I'm on my way to my goal weight!

I was prescribed $T$ for anxiety I took it home and managed to take it for 2 days but immediately noticed severe insomnia that after two days made me stop taking it. On top of the inability to sleep despite feeling tired I had absolutely zero appetite. In the little over 48 hours I had only managed to eat a handful of cherries. However when I was on the drug I did notice less irritability and increased fatigue which I attributed to not sleeping or eating.

I'm on day two of $T$, and just took third dose. I couldn't breath out of my nose and had the worst aches and pain imaginable. Woke up this morning still weak but I can breath out of both nostrils now and the aches and pains are finally dwindling a little. I have not experienced nausea related to the meds just the influenza has made me feel nauseated along with the many over the counter medications I have been taking. This drug works. If I woke up in pain like I felt last night I was going to the hospital. Thank goodness for this drug.

I used to be prescribed oxycontin, and became very addicted to pain medicines. I take $T$ now after detoxing to keep me straight, and take the edge off. This pill keeps me satisfied as far as wanting to use an opiate (pain killers), because I have a very strong mental and physical addiction to opiates.

I've been using $T$ for three months and I'm finally taking this emotional draining mister out this next cycle. I was so excited to use $T$ at first but as each month went by I felt more and more depressed and miserable. My labido went down incredibly low to the point where the thought of even having sex would just give me headaches. I was never like this and I've become an emotional beast using this and it has effected the relationship I'm currently in. I don't recommend this!

After exhausting ALL options, $T$ did job. I had  severe facial acne and now (3 months later on 100mg/day) I'm 100% clear. I saw a difference in the size of inflammation overnight. Experienced vertigo for the 1st month but you eventually reach equilibrium. My only concern is will it continue to stay clear. Fingers Crossed!

Have suffered from allergies and 2 to 4 sinus infections yearly for most of my life. Have tried many antibiotics, but $T$ works the best with the least side effects. After only 2 doses of a 10 day course I already felt 50% better. I am an RN and I have seen Zpak and Augmentin fail people during sinusitis treatment. This drug is my go-to now. It truly cures the infection. I only get maybe one acute sinusitis per year now, thanks to this drug.

I called the doctor and told her I have indigestion from hell gas, stomach bloating, explosive diaharra, nausea. She said to hang in there it will get better.  I took the last shot today and already feeling the side effects.  I want to know why the hell a company would make medicine like this.  I will never take this again.  Very displeased!

I hated being on $T$. It caused me to gain a lot of weight, so much so and so quickly it actually scared me. I was incredibly depressed and sad all the time finding myself crying nearly every day whereas I am normally a person who almost never cries or gets overly emotional. I had difficulty breathing and felt like my chest was weighed down. Anxiety and panic attacks became my daily norm.

I started taking $T$ six days ago to treat neuropathy pain in my feet and lower legs. It, like gabapentin that I was taking before this, is giving me severe arthritis pain in my hands and knees, which I did not have before. I will discontinue the use today. It stopped the neuropathic pain but is crippling me in other ways. I will go back to treatments with NSAIDS and acetaminophen.

I have had a period going on 4 months now with extremely painful cramping. $T$ is the worst birth control I have ever had.

I took $T$, as per Dr instruction, off and on for a ten year period. Please be aware, it's a good drug, but NOT in combination with: other diazapams, extra strength (7.5 ) Vicodin, PercoDAN, etc. It's considered a triple threat, being found by the DEA to be a pathway to habituation and addiction. Just saying, it's excellent on its own. I disagree with the DEA. Short-term use of this combination was extremely beneficial for me and I have, as well as, many friends and family, not found to be the case.

I originally took $T$ for three months a year ago.  It worked great during the time with minimal side effects.  Went off of it with no problem and had no heartburn for quite a long time.  When I had an acid reflux episode last fall, I took it for about a week, where all these weird side effects happened.  Developed lower right back pain, joints kept cracking when moving, and the occasional stomach pain in the lower left abdomen.  Am disappointed since it was the only thing that really helped my reflux.

I have severe dysmenorrhea which is painful periods. I cramp terribly to where I can barely walk. I was allergic to my last pill so I had to switch to $T$. At first $T$ was great. But then I noticed I went from 164 to 174. But during that time I bled for 15 days then not at all the next month. Severe cramping. Depression. Mood swings. Migraines where I can't be around light it sound. As well as acne on my jaw line and clusters. I never get acne. Now I weigh 187. 23 pounds I gained. Best believe I'm switching ASAP.

So, I tried a store brand this time, and I am doing horribly. If I only had a yeast infection caused by antibiotics before, now I am miserable, itching like crazy, burning like hell, and short of sleep. I used $T$ on Friday evening, and today is Monday evening with worse than ever itching and burning. I could barely sit at work today, and I hurt when I have to wipe myself after going to the bathroom. The skin looks raw all the way up to my butt. Are they trying to kill us?

I've been taking $T$ since January 2013 for depression and insomnia it has worked wonders. Except for the weight gain factor. You feel the need to snack all the time which has caused me to develop bulimia. I have a past of anorexia and literally everyone in my immediate family has had eating disorders. Other than that.

I've had the $T$ for 2 years. I had my period for a couple months and then nothing since. No cramping or spotting. I do have close to zero libido which I actually don't mind but obviously may be an issue for others.  Overall I'm satisfied with it.

I had been taking ortho tri cyclen lo but had to switch to this generic $T$. I started it on vacation with my fiance in Hawaii and it made me SO moody, irritable, angry, and crazy! Not much can ruin a vaca in Hawaii, but it definitely caused me to start a lot of fights with my s/o. Seriously, these side effects are so real. I'm sure it affects everyone differently, but I'm switching right away. That's the first thing my fiance, said to me too- caused me to not act my normal self, cry about everything and make everything a difficult situation. Such a terrible experience.

Used $T$ for 4 days and no results whatsoever. Typical it show at least redness. Tolak has shown none. More so, the formulation of it is horrible in that there are little white clumps Right out of the tube that make application difficult. The manufacturer offers hugely discounted coupons. You're better off buying the generic for better results.

I took $T$ for about 3 years. About 6 months ago, my dosage was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg. At first there were no problems. After a couple of months, I started having shortness of breath, chest pain, tremors, fatigue and vomiting. I went to the ER with chest pains and shortness of breath. They could find nothing wrong with my heart. I was sent to a cardiologist to have Holter monitoring, echocardiagram and stress test. Nothing. Had a pulmonary function test. Nothing. The $T$ brought my cholesterol down to 177, so my doctor took me off of it to see if it made any difference with all my health problems. It did. Within 3 days I was starting to feel better. Within a week I was back to my old self again.

I've only been taking this for a month. I got 25mg of $T$ at night. I have anxiety attacks and sometimes I shake, this hasn't been helping at all with that.

After having to pay a but load out of pocket for $T$ i slowly found out it was not for me. It put me in a hyper-manic state. Had to constantly be moving. Would wake up every morning at 7 am, when the sunlight started peaking in my room, regardless of what time I was finally able to pass out. And worst of all, it caused me to have problems using the restroom. No matter how hard I tried or what I did it made me not able to urinate.

$T$ works well for norepinephrine uptake inhibition which is my problem.  However, it can cause anorgasmia in men over 50 years of age.  I can have an erection and sexual intercourse but I never finish the job.  One of the side effects listed for this drug if you read the small print.

Just got $T$ inserted today. Was on bc for years tried pill patch etc. Hubby then got snip which failed but we are delighted with our little bundle of joy. Really did not know what to expect and was very nervous about insertion. I took ponston before hand and it did not hurt. Measurement went fine then when inserted felt something but very mild. Not like some reviews. So far so good but dont have it long enough to comment on side effects. Insertion not as bad as i expected!

I was taking Aviane before and transferred my prescription to a different pharmacy. There they gave me $T$ since they did not have aviane... Worst experience of my life. Constant headaches and acne were the main symptoms right before my period. Extremely painful periods as well. If you are experiencing these symptoms while on $T$, I would highly recommend trying aviane. I do not have any headaches or acne and my periods are pain free.

$T$ is THE absolute worst birth control and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. When I first had it placed I had my period for 5 MONTHS STRAIGHT. Now I've had it for almost 2 years (Ive procrastinated getting it out) my periods can last from 15-30 days, easy. And I'm lucky if I get 10 days inbetween them. Aside from that, my arm aches and throbs. I have heard so many horror stories about this birth control plan on getting it taken out soon. LADIES, #SayNoToNexplannon!

$T$ didn't have an awful taste (I bought the liquid) and took care of my cough.  Unfortunately, I had severe diarrhea and ended up having to take an anti-diarrheal.  I probably won't use this medication again - the diarrhea was horrible! I would rather have a cough!

It's been relatively side effect free for me and I can function pretty well day to day because of it.

$T$ did very little for me. My Doctor prescribed it as an alternative to Xanax until a full clinical work up could be done. As a moderate to heavy drinker, he did not advise me that this is used to pull people from the disease. I don't feel like I have issues with alcoholism but it really messed me up when mixing the two. Felt stoned or comatosed. Taking $T$ sober did almost nothing anyway except when I take 2 or 3 at a time and still it does not release the anxiety I have.

I'm bipolar and $T$ is the only medication (out of many, many) that really helps my bipolar and it works almost instantaneously for me.  I first went on $T$ to gain weight because I was trying to recover from anorexia and struggling, but stayed on it for my bipolar.  I did gain weight and I eat tons, but I have a good metabolism and $T$ just brings me up to my medically ideal weight.

I have used $T$ and the generic version a few times before and it has worked wonderful. However, thats not always the case. I had had sex and taken the pill about 24 hours after the encounter.

I started on a low-dose liquid form of $T$ and at first it seemed to be really lifting my mood, reducing my anxiety, and boosting my self esteem. But I soon began experiencing extreme irratibility and episodes of destructive rage aimed at my belongings or myself.  I loved the benefits, but the side effects were ruining my life and relationships. I also experienced severe prolonged pms (3 weeks duration), constant breast pain and swelling, unrestorative sleep, and awful vivid lifelike nightmares. Just horrible!

This is some of the worst pain of my life. DO NOT USE $T$! The inside of my vagina is itching so bad and burning. I took two showers and got a large amount of the cream out but it has only helped relieve the pain slightly. Ice pack helped but its been an hour and I feel like little people are running around my vagina wearing cleats. Took a Benadryl so hopefully that'll let me rest finally. $T$ is 10x worse than the YI symptoms!!!

I had my first outbreak at 19 and maybe 1-2 minor outbreaks. At 38, my outbreaks became noticeable and frequent- as soon as the itching subsided, it would appear again 3 days later. Then my anus started to itch. After a visit to my gynecologist, I walked away with a prescription for 500 mg of $T$ to be taken daily. One week later I had an outbreak similar to my first, except now my buttocks and thighs were included. I had a 1 inch lesion on my inner  buttocks and my vagina was swollen and weeping. I stopped the $T$ after about 20 days. The symptoms abated 3 days later.

I started taking $T$ and it was supposed to be 6 weeks to take effect. I felt instantly calmer, happen the NEXT day! Couldn't believe it. Started at 10mg moved to 20 MG in year of use. My problem now is  its been 7 years of working for me but 20mg doesn't have same effect of earlier years. I want to have  increase in MG use.

I have a lot of kidney stones so I get a lot of urinary tract infections. I am on $T$ now and it only took 3 long days to get rid of the fever and feel better. I can't take Bactrim and some others so I don't have a lot of choices, but this really worked for me!

I began taking $T$ in September 2014. I used it for 6 months and lost 50 pounds. I had a few side effects such as constipation and loss of sleep, but both were very manageable. This medication reduced my appetite so much that at times I had to force myself to eat just to make sure I was taking in at least 1000 calories a day as directed by my doctor. I went off the medication and gained about 10 pounds back, so now I am restarting the medicine after being off a while. Its no miracle drug, but it is a great tool.

I have used other birth control in the past that has regulated my periods like clockwork after one month of use. I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and was told $T$ was one of the only pills that did not have a side effect of higher BP.  I gave it 4 consistent months and after I have experienced epic bleeding, to the point it was like having 2 periods back to back, I decided it wasn't for me!

Took the shot of $T$ and was bleeding 2 weeks straight every other week. Then August 2014 i started bleeding again and i have yet to stop. It is now a year today when i first took my shot. I now have another dr and she says after i do a pelvic ultrasound and blood work, she will put me on the pill if everything looks normal. The pill will regulate my cycle after about a month taking it. Worst product!

$T$ is only effective if you have mild arthritis. If you have almost no cartilage left it is useless. I wish I had known this before I tried this injection. I have moderate-severe arthritis and got a week or 2 of relief.

The first time I took $T$ was when I was having dental work and it was prescribed for the acute anxiety I feel with dentists. This past year my regular doctor suggested I might like to take it from time to time because of depression and anxiety. It helps tremendously. I usually break the .25 mg pill in half and just take half of one. I do not use it every day, but when I need it, it's wonderful and gets me to the next day.

My husband has RA. His doctor sent him to the Clinic to ensure he had no heart issues before they put him and they didn't found any heart issues so he started $T$. In January 2013 Tony had a sizable aneurism on his aorta so he underwent heart surgery. In April due to infections he had a 14 Hour surgery to redo all he had done in January. He died on Mothers Day may 12, 2013 of infection. I'm saying that he had a good heart yet two month s after taking $T$ he doesn't. I would not recommend it!

Having tried both Imatinib and Nilotinib, my Haemotologist tried me on $T$ - the effect this drug had on me was devastating, after only 3 days my body literally began to shut down, I was so weak I was crawling on my hands and knees just to go to the bathroom. After two weeks off it was decided to try a greatly reduced dosage (50mg) every other day but even at that I had little to no quality of life.

Hello strangers. Im here to share my experience of taking emergency contraception, $T$. My period cycle has been very irregular last 3 monthes , assumed stresses. Therefore it was very hard to know when exactly my ovulation was. On November 19th, I had unprotected sex with my lover unexpectedly. After 17hours I had $T$ tablet. Regardless how much I worried, my period started today! It was actually starting early then I thought. So dont worry too much! It really works! Release your worries!

My LDL is high HDL is low and triglycerides are high. Dr. Recommend me for $T$ 5 mg. initially I couldn't recognise the leg pain and numbness. I couldn't sleep for several night while on this medicine for few days. I stopped taking $T$ after reading its reviews and that stopped my leg pain!

I just had $T$ placed 6/4/13. The process was simple enough, the only pain I felt was the numbing process, then just tugging sensations as the Doctor placed the insert.  My biggest scare was that it would come out, it is still there so far! I haven't had any adverse side effects, only itching which I assume is my arm healing. I have been on pills since I was 15, so 16 years later I am excited to try a new method that I don't have to think about everyday. A friend recommended it to me and I would definitely recommend it anyone!

$T$ does a fair job with my depression, which is better described as low frustration tolerance and rage issues.  The side effects I had included horrible nightmares, a very frightening condition known as sleep paralysis and brain zaps, described by many of the users on this site.  I rate it a 2 and am now transitioning to another SSRI

Started taking $T$ and in a few days short of 6 weeks, I'm down 26 lbs.  Granted I have about 50 lbs more to go.  I have experienced a fair amount of nausea.  It was pretty bad, but it is getting better. I'm drinking more water than ever, partly because it seems to reduce the nausea.  The side effects are a little for me, but I like the results so I will march on.

Ok I had $T$ inserted six weeks after my daughter was born Nov 2012. I had some cramping and bleeding nothing bad tho. I loved it until Easter 2013 I had one breast swell it was a small cyst. And no period for six months well of course I didn't think it was $T$. Then my period suddenly came back. I have suffered a miscarriage. I have been so moody, cramps awful cramps, low sex drive my poor husband, breast swelling and tenderness again, cysts on both ovaries, hair loss, depression. I'm getting $T$ yanked as soon as possible. And going back on the pill. I hate it! Do not recommend for anyone!

I've been on $T$ for 5 years. I hated it at first because I was only in 7th grade, weighed only 130lbs and was on 900mg. When I first took it I slept for three and a half days. Now it gives me this horrible urge to eat and I can't stop. A few years back it was lowered to 600mg (still a little to high for my liking) but it has helped with my bipolar and my impulses. It does actually help but avoid being on such a high dose.

$T$ had been the best thing I have ever had. Regardless of the minor side effects I had it has saved me from constant diarrhea after having my gall bladder removed. I spent 8 miserable months having diarrhea multiple times a day. This has stopped it completely with little to no side effects. It does make me feel full if I take it right before I eat.

I have tried $T$. It only work if I drink half the bottle. I took one $T$ and started drinking a lot of water, in about an hour was going and had no cramps or bloating feeling. Just don't pass gas because that's probably not what that is. Don't forget the WATER.

Do not let the negative reviews scare you! I'm glad I didn't! Everybody is different you won't know how this birth control will work until you try it. I have had $T$ for 6 months, I still get a period though sometimes I skip a month. When I do get my period it is light panty liner light. No acne no weight gain, libido has not changed, no cravings, no mood swings. This has been the best birth control for me!

I got the $T$ TODAY. This is the first time I've taken birth control. It was inserted about 2 hours ago. As of now, I am feeling cramps. Just like regular period cramps. When it was inserted, it didn't feel much different than a pap. I did feel a few cramps, which were pretty bearable. My legs started shaking during the process, but I think it's because I almost let my nerves get the best of me. My doctor explained the whole process before doing anything, which was good. I would recommend this product!

I was given $T$ in a hospital ER for a migraine. One of the single worst experiences of my life. I would not wish the side effects on my worst enemy. It cause me such extreme anxiety that I wanted to pull out my IV. I felt so out of control. After I left the hospital, I had such paranoia, that I didn't want to be left alone. Took a day or two to get back to normal. NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!

I was on $T$ for about 4 years. I always took it on time. I never had any side effects. My periods only lasted about 4 to 5 days. The periods were pretty normal and no cramps. I recommend this drug to anyone as long as you don't forget to take it!

I took $T$ Friday night and went to bed. I was rock hard most of the night. I have mild erectile dysfunction. With this medicine I go for hours. It gives you the confidence that you can think what you're going to do next and stop worrying about if its going to stay hard. My erections are firmer for some days after. No headaches or other side-effects.

$T$ does help me calm down and focus (it also really helped me with my anxiety) but the side effects of vomiting, feeling like I don't care about the world and my head is squished in, and ultimately my inability to stay awake throughout the day left me asking my doctor for a change of medication. For reference, this was my first medication used to manage my adult ADHD and I started on one pill for three days and was moved up to two and these side effects worsened with two pills.
Atomoxetine

I have been taking $T$ for 2 weeks now and have gone from 330 pounds to 320. That's a huge deal for me because I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and typically cannot lose weight. It suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat. I have had no side effects at all and haven't increased my exercise. I am very happy with $T$. Hopefully it continues to go well.

I suffer from harm-ocd (violent impulsive thoughts), and im taking $T$ for almost 2 years now. It helped me much but it didnt eliminate OCD. Though, it reduced anxiety and the frequency my mind produces impulsive thoughts with. In the past, i had pains in the back side of my head and it made them go away. Nonetheless, I also had some side effects. If i take it late at night, it will cause me tension making it hard for me to sleep.

This is the worst! I have taken Desogen and Apri, but switched to $T$ a few months ago when it was cheaper and it was supposed to be the same. But it has made me bloated, retain water and I had breakthrough bleeding at all different times of the month. Can't wait to finish off these last packs and swtich to something I like again, even if it costs more. Don't get it!

Diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at age 32, apparently the sweet spot for diagnosis. Started taking $T$ about 10 years ago and haven't had any MS symptoms for over 3 years. Still get flu like symptoms. I take extra strength Ibuprofen before injection and it helps to make life easier to handle.

I was involved in a car accident half a year ago and misaligned my spine.  I was initially on $T$. It works in about 40 mins and numbs most of my pain. Left slightly lightheaded but not shy compared to the pain is was in.  I would recommend this medication to others.

I've only been on $T$ for 8 days but my side effects are minimal.  I started on 5 mg and am moving to 10mg today.  Fingers crossed that this works.  So far this has been the best in minimal side effects compared to others I have taken.
Paxil

The only reason why I wouldn't give $T$ a 10 is because it started to give me recurring and unbearable BV that I could not stand to deal with. Everything else was perfect! Might have had my period a few extra days but my flow was lighter-normal, no acne, no mood swing, no bloat. I did get slightly stronger cramps but that was fine.

Well I have had the $T$ for a little over 2 months. I have been bleeding 6 out of the 9 weeks I have been on this. I got the implant because of my endometriosis and heavy painful bleeding. The second month I was cramping for 5 days before I even started my period and today marks the 26th day I have been spotting and bleeding.  Right now I'm frustrated because I have become anemic and I'm tired of bleeding and cramping.

So far $T$ has saved my life. After experiencing a traumatic experience I spiralled into a heavy depression coupled with anxiety. It's only been one week and I'm no longer crying daily and the hopeless feeling is subsiding. It's also helped stopped the obsessive thoughts I've been having about the traumatic event.

This hurts so bad ! This is my first time using $T$ and I wish I would have tried the yogurt because that seems like it helps better then the cream. I'm itching so much and it's burning. I'm trying the cold water bottle and putting it down there and it isn't helping much!

This blue generic version of $T$ is worthless. Instead of enabling sleep, I become restless and agitated. In addition, I've had a migraine since the pharmacy filled my prescription with this. I have degenerative discs in my spine, which is very painful, and need it to sleep. Two weeks now without sleep on these pills.

Make sure you take the $T$ within 24 hours! I took the pill 1 hour after my mishap. I had small cramps a few days later and a week after taking the pill I spotted for about half a day then a light period started right after.. it lasted only a few days. I usually have light periods anyways. This pill works just try not to stress and take if as soon as possible.

So I decided to give this birthcontrol $T$ a try and absolutely regret my decision. I had absolutely heavy flow whenever my period hit, cramps that made me double over in pain, and it was to the point that I had trouble walking normal due to my period being so heavy. I went back to my old birth control and had no problems like this. It was to the point that I was begged to be changed back to my old birth control.

I began using $T$ after I had an experience with some mild acne. The first two weeks were horrible - my acne went from mild to severe in a matter of days. However, that &#039;s how the medicine works. It pushes the acne out and allows your skin to heal. So even though the first two weeks are hell, it does work. Once the initial breakout clears you're home free.

As far as I am concerned,  $T$ is a miracle drug.  I had a boil that wouldn't go away.  I tried soaking, tea tree oil and a lot of other homeopathic remedies.

Too scared to ask if I could try anything else because this is supposed to be the safest drug available.

After looking at all birth control I decided to go with $T$ since it had the least side effects. This is my first birth control ever and I was worried how I would feel. I read the reviews on here and was expecting a horrible headache the first day I put it on but I didn't feel any different at all. It's still my first week but so far, everything is great!

The convenience of $T$ is great as there is no daily time to take a pill, only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone and it never falls out, I never feel it and changing it is simple, too. I would give the $T$ a ten out of ten just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable, too. But, there are some downsides as I have a VERY low tolerance to alcohol when on the $T$. Very emotional, tired, and strung out all the time. I was on the pill before and none of these happened. I also have longer periods.

I recently had unprotected sex I am almost positive I was on my most fertile day but here I am, 12 days later after taking the $T$ and I am not pregnant.

For the people who are worried about taking $T$ because of vomiting or worse symptoms, there is no need to worry. I was worried of vomiting when my doctor prescribed it too me too. To lessen the chance or basically exterminate the chance of vomiting, have a snack or a meal and you won't feel a thing. It will feel like your taking a regular medicine.

I'm currently 22 and I've had my $T$ (IUD) for close to four years (March) I love it. I do have to warn though. It does cause heavier periods for the first few months. Mine went from three days to about a week long. There will be cramping. But I've never had cramps to begins with. So this was new. If you can get through the first 4-6 months of this, it is the best form of birth control. I always recommend it to my lady friends!

I've been on $T$ for 4ish years now. For me, the experience was normal. I was moody on my periods (nothing new) and a big decrease in acne! But now I am thinking of switching to a stronger birth control, even though I've been on $T$ for so long and love the product I think my body needs a change in medication. Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne, no weight gain, no pregnancy scares, no depression or moodiness for the most part. Good for older teens!

I was given this mediation $T$ 6 years ago. I had a lot of problems like fibromyalgia, migraines, depression, insomnia, IBS -C. When I was first $T$ at 25mg I could sleep for the first time in years. I was waking up on the morning refreshed and happy. I noticed later my migraines were not as often as I normally would have them. This drug is a life saver. My fibromyalgia pain is less, migraines less, anxiety way less and it also improved my IBS C symptoms. I would recommend $T$ to anyone!!

I have been taking $T$ for MANY years. I started having weird feelings, like I was going to die, I kept ending up in the ER. The doctors kept telling me it was Anxiety. I DIDN'T understand why anxiety would make me feel this way. I have tried many, many anxiety medicines, Paxil, Effexor, Xanax, Lamictal, Geodon, and many more. NONE have worked the way $T$ works. With $T$ I feel safe and I do not get the jittery feelings. I am so grateful to have a medication that actually works for me!
