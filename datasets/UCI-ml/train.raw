This is my first time using $T$ and at first it decreased my libido and the downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) where I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control

Hi all, My son who is 8 was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the doctor recommended $T$. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school and the patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

I took this medication $T$ for only two weeks and noticed right away I would go less often to the toilet, and it was much easier to dispense the urine. But had to stop taking this as I started having incredibly intense mood swings, aggression, feel clumsy and dizzy all the time with blurry vision, memory problems or mind blanks. runny nose, weakness, tiredness.

I appreciate $T$. Although my thyroid level is low, a supplement helps to equalize this problem. I've been through at least 25 different medications to stabilize my Bipolar diagnosis. I always wanted to be of normal state of mind. $T$ has allowed me to be equally yoked with myself.

My husband (age 63) has been having problems with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction as well. Then his doctor put him on a small daily dose (5 mg) of $T$ and boom! He is bigger and harder than he was at 35. I am loving this. I have always had a powerful sex drive, and I was resigning myself to watching that fade away. I'm now clearing my schedule for action and honestly feeling more satisfied than I did at 25.

Im 58 and recently started on this medicine $T$ and get almost immediate relief of vulvar dryness and pain.

I started $T$ as one of my first anti depressants for MDD and it made me horribly sick. I was nauseous all day, and wouldn't eat for days at a time. I stayed on it to try and get thorough the side effects but they wouldn't stop, I was throwing up every other day

The convenience of $T$ is great as there is no daily time to take a pill, only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone and it never falls out, I never feel it and changing it is simple, too. I would give the $T$ a ten out of ten just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable, too. But, there are some downsides as I have a VERY low tolerance to alcohol when on the $T$. Very emotional, tired, and strung out all the time. I was on the pill before and none of these happened. I also have longer periods.

Awful medicine, the worst. The side effects outweigh the benefit.  Headache the first night, leg and back pain, Sensitive skin,  just awful. Pain got worse and worse.

This cream $T$ is absolutely horrible. I will admit the cream initially does what is says it will do, gets rid of the redness. However this is completely temporary and what comes afterward is a serious rebound. I spent the day outside in the cold weather and when I came back in around 6 hours later my face has never felt hotter in my life. My skin burned and was unbelievably deep red, it looked as if I had held my face up against a fire. This lasted around 2-3 hours.

I try not to take medicine unless I am really sick but my doctor recommended I take $T$ for a small cyst on my eye lid. After the first day I developed stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I was not sure if it was due to the medicine so I continued to take it for two more days. When the condition did not get any better I stopped. Now it has now been a week since I first took the $T$ and I still have stomach cramps and diarrhea.

$T$ has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis. I am on my 3rd shot. No more period, but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due. I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more. I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didn't get it. I am glad I took the chance to see how it works rather than reacted to it. Everyone is different. I am very satisfied with it.

I've been on $T$ for 6 months. I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period and I wanted to avoid it altogether. The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 25 days, mostly light. $T$ is now working perfectly for me. It's been wonderful not having a period for a few months. I'd recommend this birth control to anyone.

I was prescribed $T$ by my ophthalmologist due to severe dry eye caused by Accutune. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it.

I stopped using the product after 2 year, and my eyes have improved so much I no longer need to use it, I love this product!

I was essentially mis-prescribed Actiq when I should have been getting $T$ patches for my cancer pain.  This caused problems with both bolus dosing and build-up of opioid tolerance with the Actiq that have not been nearly as great a problem with $T$ patches.Other patients may have different experiences; however for chronic cancer pain, the patches might be considered before use of Actiq.

I have never had a really really bad acne just a few spots here and there so when I went to see the dermatologist they prescribed me this gel $T$ to put on every night over my whole face. Firstly everything was going fine I didn't see a difference however one night when I put my cream on and then waking up on the next morning my skin was literally burnt and my forehead was covered in those little spots which was terrible and they looked even worse with make up on because it was extremely bumpy. Worst product!

When I was a fifteen year old freshman in high school I broke out with severe acne. In literally one week my skin went from perfectly clear to large acne blotches on my cheeks, chin and neck that were painful to touch. After trying everything in the arsenal at the time my dermatologist recommended $T$. After a month and a half of treatment my acne was gone completely, and my skin clearer everyday thereafter. This medicine changed my life for the better as I have never needed to use/take another acne medication.

Had the $T$ inserted in November. Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months. Everything was great until I noticed my clothes weren't fitting anymore. I've gained pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise. I also started losing my hair a few weeks ago, and began sprouting chin hair that I didn't have before, which is making me feel very depressed. I am beyond frustrated and am having it removed in a few days.

Been taking this medication $T$ for 6 years. I have a good stream and it was prescribed by my doctor because I wasn't emptying my bladder fully due to a bladder that did not have the muscle tone that it once had.

Switched back to my remaining $T$ and found equivalent product in Europe too. Just perfect flow, day and night! No side effects.

My Endo insisted I switch from lantus to $T$.  I was quite stable on lantus and humalog for over 7 years but she said it was better.  I've been a diabetic for almost 35 years and so I was very hesitant to switch.  I should have listened to myself.  The first 3 weeks were okay but not better.  Then I started feeling breathless and fatigued.  It took me awhile to realize it was the $T$. I switched back to lantus a week ago and I am already feeling better.

$T$ causes persistent nausea in some users as per their website. For most people it goes away after a few weeks--but not all. Initially I was also itchy and a little weepy. I will have to switch as I don't want to be chained to zofran. Otherwise, worked fine as an alternative to paxil.

Had unprotected sex and then I took $T$ 35 hours after, and after some days I decided that what I could do, is wait... so I stopped worrying and became comfortable, and I was waiting for my period.. finally it came a week late. So, because I know the struggle, DO NOT PANIC, this pill is very very effective because you dont get pregrant immidietly.

I had a UTI that went into a kidney infection, They put me on $T$, didn't notice any side effects until a few days later, I started feeling depressed out of no where and it got worse from there, I ended up in the hospital with the worst headache of my life, I was shaking and throwing up. The depression got so bad I ended up at the  psychiatric hospital, worst mistake!

Stay away from this medication $T$. The first day used, I was impressed, but 2 days later I had a rebound and my face was burning like hell. I waited like 4 days to re-apply and see what happens, but I lost sensation on my lips and they got swollen. Then, after 24 hours the rebound got worse and was like two weeks after my skin stopped burning!

$T$ works pretty well, do not need to use my rescue inhaler as often, but the one main downside is that it continuously causes me to have sinuitis which then causes a migraine.

I have been on $T$ since September 5th. The first month was great then on October 9th my resting heart rate went from sixty-one to seventy and when I walk it suddenly goes to one hundred forty for no reason. I work out 6 days a week and it doesn't make any sence to me. Going back to my doctor tomorrow to figure it out.

I have been on this medication $T$ for 37 days.  My day and night sweats are no longer severe. My day sweats are no longer embarrassing, e.g. while talking with coworkers, I would without warning began to get warm, hot, and then dripping in sweat to include my hair.  My mood swings are gone, I am back to normal.  LOVING IT.

I started $T$ 45mg straight off when I was 22 years old  I have since been taken off from it and still paying the price for it. It made me hungry constantly i gained a total of fifty pounds in 7 months I had no energy at all and no feelings no happy thoughts no sad thoughts I was literally a zombie. Worst mistake ever!

When i first started using $T$, it burned for a few minutes. I was afriad this would be the rest of my life. Nope! Two weeks later the burning stopped. This goes under my arm and I love it! It is worth the extra 25 dollars from my insurance. I do recommend!

I am 25 years old and have been taking this $T$ for over 2 years now. My husband and I have been dieting and exercising for the past year and half and I have only gained weight, never lost. I finally went to my doctor with the following symptoms: tired all the time even with 8 hours of sleep, mood swings, depression, sadness, crying out of no where, weight gain and inability to loose weight, bad skin. I recently read these reviews on $T$ and bam! I am getting off this immediately and I am really upset I did not read these sooner.

This birthcontrol $T$ is terrible! I am 28 years old was given this since I was diagnosed with PCOS. I took it for 3 weeks and stopped. The 2nd week I was bleeding, bad cramping, and clotting as well...I just assumed it was my body getting used to it after that I got bad bloating to the point that my bladder had pressure on it and I felt the full urgency feeling but did not have a UTI! I had horrible depression and anxiety as well, It drove me NUTS!!!!!!!

I took $T$ for a little over 2 years.  From around the age of sixteen to eighteen.  I gained a little bit of weight, not much but EXTREMELY hard to lose.  Also, I experienced mood swings frequently.  Sometimes getting extremely upset and feeling the need to cry.  But the reason I stopped taking $T$ was because I started to get EXTREMELY BAD migraines/headaches.  These headaches would come VERY frequently.

I found out I had genital hsv about a month ago. The doctor found a lesion by the vaginal opening, that looked like little paper cuts apparently.

$T$ has been the most wonderful medicine for my 2 abscessed teeth. Yes both hit me at one time and it was very very painful and within 36 hours of taking it I could see a big difference such as less pain and decreased swelling. This is day 6 and I have no pain and no swelling.

Had unprotected sex and about 38 hours later, I took $T$ with food and water. I was expecting my period about a week from that day. Throughout the whole time waiting for my period I had absolutely zero side affects, and it really really worried me. It was about 2 weeks after I took it that I finally got my period, and I was never so happy to be in so much pain.

Awful! I use $T$ as the one time treatment around eleven pm and I'm up at 2am with the most intense itching/burning sensation of my life! I bought it because the antibiotic I'm taking gave me a YI but this is completely terrible! I want to scratch my vag off. NEVER again.

My Dr agreed to over see putting me on $T$ because he watched as I devotedly pursued everything else to no avail. I have now been on this for 2 week and have dropped 8 lbs. I have to go and have all the patience in the world as long as I see progress. I do get tired midday laydown, ten minutes get up, I do get constipated but take those probiotic gummies that seem to help. I crave sweet but nothing really sounds good. I plan to start walking just a mile daily.

At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 22. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK and $T$ is the only thing that has ever worked for me. Pain usually gone after 25 minutes, before I took $T$ I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Great product!

I had a wonderful experience with $T$. This is the only acne medication that didn't dry out my skin after using it. I thought I would never have a good experience with acne medications. $T$ is a smooth, moisturizing acne medication that leaves your skin feeling great. With a couple days the redness and swelling of my acne went down significantly. I don't see myself ever using another acne medication.

I've been on $T$ for a few months now, for major depression/anxiety. The $T$ is working well for me. I have more good days. I don't feel sedated, just more positive and functional. As far as side effects, I get an upset stomach if I don't eat before I take it. I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. Overall, it's effective for me, but I have to be more careful to avoid side effects.

Took this pill $T$ for Acne and Birth Control.  I have had a side effect that very few people had which was hair loss in the scalp.  Big amounts of hair would come out when I would shower.  I realized this happened to me with a previous birth control as well but want to note for others as a precaution. This also gave me a very backed up system which I never get.  I got extremely nauseous, very moody, heartburn, anxiety and some depression. Literally worst product!

I went on this med $T$ last year for PMDD, like severe PMS, and did fine the first 6 months. I'm not sure why, but suddenly my periods are 2 weeks long instead of one. I'm also having the same severity, if not more, of cramps that I had before I started. It has made my mood issues improve, though. I don't feel nearly as depressed as I did before taking it.

I just finished my first pack of $T$ two days ago and I will not be taking it again. In the beginning I was fine. Now that it's been a month I can tell you I'm in a place I don't recognize. Every little thing my boyfriend does I get upset over, I'm constantly crying and paranoid, never want to get out of bed and I'm depressed. This is miserable, and I'm hoping that within the next few days I'll feel normal again after being off of this.

I have struggled with ADD since I was in grade school. Although diagnosed, my mother was not about putting me on medication. That being said I struggled really bad until I graduated. I am now 22, have been out on almost any ADD/ADHD medication you can think of. My doctor decided to put me on $T$ tablets let me tell you it has saved my life!!!!!! It lasts all day for me, I am more focused, my heart rate doesn't jump to extremes. It actually makes me more relaxed, enjoyable to be around.

I have had $T$ for a year now. Since then I've remained around the same weight, my skin has stayed clear, and I have a much lighter period then I used to. Only negatives I've had are random spotting which I've had on previous birth controls as well. I highly recommend $T$!

$T$ is terrible. Burns. Badly. Thought I could wait it out- spent two hours in bed reading reviews which made me feel better but I should be sleeping. Going to try to push it out and probably spend the night with an ice pack between my legs......asking for Diflucan tomorrow because this is just not worth it. More expensive too. All around just bad.

I was on $T$ for about 2 months, I really noticed the loss of appetite and lost my sweet tooth. My weight came down and my blood sugar levels dropped from 8.5 to 6. I was really happy with the medicine as it works fine until the known side effects started to show. They were nausea this happened approx once a week in the fourth week in on taking the medicine and bloating, indigestion, a lot of passing wind and acidy burps.

Started using $T$ and within 2 weeks saw blood glucose more than half to good levels I've not seen for years (literally) no major side effects - felt sick twice within a day or two of first dose but apart from that all ok. Injecting in fatty tissue of stomach hardly any pain. Very well designed device and needle almost painless. I would recommend this to those who have gone to max on oral meds and need that extra help, this really is the magic bullet for me!

I am 69 years old.  Prior to starting  5 pumps daily of $T$ 5 months ago, low energy and almost no sex drive plus often could not maintain an erection.  After only a couple of weeks, there was a big turnaround, good erections and libido what it was at age 40. Did notice I was a bit more aggressive.  Then, about the 3rd month things went downhill with things back pretty much as they were before. Got a mix feeling!

I was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia after months of falling asleep during the day and very early at night.

The next 2 days, I felt tired and dragging again.  The last day, I was tired, depressed, and crying on and off all day.  I am now off the medication.

Before starting $T$ at age 22 I was going to the bathroom about once every 3 weeks. Within 24 hours of starting $T$, I went to the bathroom. Yes, the first few days it was diarrhea. Within the first week, I was having regular bowel movements and have been having about 2/day since then. MY STOMACH PAIN HAS DISAPPEARED (that's huge!!!!) Gas? Yes, all the time. Diarrhea? Only if I take it too late in the day. Increased hunger? Yes, obviously, because my stomach is empty. Worth it? 5 billion percent!!

I have been on $T$ for about a year and a half now. This has honestly been one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had. When I first got it inserted in my arm I noticed I had my period practically everyday and this went on for about 3 months. Everyday I have spotting and it's gotten to the point where I have to wear a tampon every day . Every time I have sex there is always blood everywhere. And it's hard explaining why I am always on my period to my partner and it's made me self conscious.

I have to say $T$ was great! as it Works within 30-45 min after dosing. Done using bathroom within 3-3 1/2 hours. Tips: Eat lightly 2 or so days prior, eating mainly soft foods. Hydrate yourself several days prior also, making sure to get lots of extra fluids/electrolytes. Don't drink too much right before dosing so that you can get all the solution/water down comfortably. And RELAX! Positive attitude goes along way! I would definitely use this product again.

I have been on the $T$ every 2 days a little over 3 years for chronic pain due to a failed lumbar fusion surgery. These patches were a Godsend.

Suffered from anxiety and depression for 3 months with over 20 side effects. Finally doctor gave me $T$ and almost overnight I seemed to improve. Had my first full sleep in 3 months and felt like eating again. Slowly over the course of 1 week all side effects left me and within 2 weeks I was more or less off the medicine. 3 months later I lead my old life again.

Sleeping great but am experiencing a great deal of fatigue especially late afternoon and evening.

Upon reaching my 8th month of pregnancy, my family all came down with bronchitis and unfortunately I caught it as well .. the doctors prescribed me the $T$ and within 24 hours I felt tremendously better, which says a lot, considering I was in so much pain I could hardly even function. It took away the body aches, the hot/cold sweats, the fever, and suppressed my coughing. Of the few antibiotics I'm able, the $T$ always has and will be my first choice - it never ceases to amaze me at how quickly and effectively it works!Highly recommended!!and two thumbs up!!

I was given $T$ for a urinary tract infection after first trying Bactrim. However, the only effect I had was that I felt speedy the first day I took it.  Subsequent days, I did not have this problem and I made sure to take it in the morning. It cured my infection wonderfully, and I had no upset stomach or yeast infection after effects. I really like this antibiotic!

Since I been taking the $T$ my period has increased In length, cramps in intensity, and heaviness in bleeding, including clots. Im hungry almost all the time, and my bra no longer fits completely (size D, before pill). The only thing this pill is effective in, is keeping you from getting pregnant. I had a scare and I did not get pregnant. But I never missed a pill and took at the same time everyday, which I was told makes it more effective.

The medicine $T$ worked great to counter my sinusitis and I was breathing better after just one dose. But the side effects are almost unbearable. Nausea, dizziness, headache, lightheaded, dry mouth and constipation. The dizziness and lightheadedness kicks in after about an hour of taking the pill and lasts for about 5 hours. Very difficult to function normally and trying to work while taking this medicine.

I have type one diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year. A friend told me about $T$ and I am forever grateful. I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area. You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that, but it's so worth it.

I was having symptoms of BV so I went to the doctor and found out it was a yeast infection, after using $T$ for just 3 days (it was a 7 day dosage) I had a major reaction, bad vaginal pains I could barely sleep. I went back to the doctor who now says it was not a reaction but possibly herpes. I had no pain no issues or anything before this cream, now possibly herpes. I am waiting on my results and praying it was in fact a reaction to this horrible cream $T$!

Hello all! I am sharing this because I want to reassure everyone that $T$ does its job extremely well. I recently had unprotected sex I am almost positive I was on my most fertile day but here I am, 12 days later after taking the $T$ and I am not pregnant. I took it within two hours after having unprotected sex. I do want to ease peoples minds that this medicine is highly effective and it has relieved me!!

For the people who are worried about taking $T$ because of vomiting or worse symptoms, there is no need to worry. I was worried of vomiting when my doctor prescribed it too me too. To lessen the chance or basically exterminate the chance of vomiting, have a snack or a meal and you won't feel a thing. It will feel like your taking a regular medicine.

I take $T$ to help balance the effects Cymbalta had on my sleep and to help with my depression. My experience has been wonderful, helps me fall asleep and sleep restfully. Together with Cymbalta, $T$ has completely eradicated my depression.

Using $T$ for parasomnia, bph and bp. But my new doc tried to give me the brand name... Is it an extended release or just much more expensive? I only take it at night and dizziness hasnt been an issue. Seems to work as well as other bph meds that I have tried, my bp has also been reasonable. Seems to make sleepwalking more infrequent which is why I tried it.

My husband tested positive for the flu on 2nd day of having symptoms. His Dr prescribed $T$ for both he and I since I slept in same bed while he was sick. One day later, I started to feel symptoms as well...aches, fever. I immediately started the $T$ was only out of commission for 1 full day. $T$ is amazing!!

I'm currently 22 and I've had my $T$ (IUD) for close to four years (March) I love it. I do have to warn though. It does cause heavier periods for the first few months. Mine went from three days to about a week long. There will be cramping. But I've never had cramps to begins with. So this was new. If you can get through the first 4-6 months of this, it is the best form of birth control. I always recommend it to my lady friends!

Hideous fungus under all toenails since age 22, I'm 52 now. My life is changed, since in adolescence and even until today, I have hidden my toes and suffered ridicule and embarrassing questions. Been taking $T$ for 4 mths as I write this.  It's a miracle. Big toenails have cleared beautifully and all other 8 nails are better. Just do it.

I have only been on $T$ for about 1 month and I just started my second week of my second month.  I guess I didn't notice earlier but I started to get slight headaches and I didn't feel very well physically and mentally. The worst part of $T$ has to be the mood swings and the sweating!  I sweat a lot even if it's cold. But the mood swings are the worst I just started feeling this and it happened while I was talking to one of my friends I just blew up on him, for no reason.  Then later on I started to feel really bad(mentally) and I cried for a while and I couldn't figure out why I was crying! I don't recommend!

I've been taking $T$ ever since I was 8. I was taken off of $T$ when I was 21 and I actually went down hill after that. I lost a lot of my friends and I can't control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it. I am 23 now and just got back on $T$ and am super happy with how it has organized my mind!

I've been on $T$ for 4ish years now. For me, the experience was normal. I was moody on my periods (nothing new) and a big decrease in acne! But now I am thinking of switching to a stronger birth control, even though I've been on $T$ for so long and love the product I think my body needs a change in medication. Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne, no weight gain, no pregnancy scares, no depression or moodiness for the most part. Good for older teens!

$T$ works mildly, not as well as stimulant medications like adderall. Unfortonately while it mildly boosted concentration and motivation it severely increased my anxiety, ,heart rate, and tremors. Stimulant medications actually decreased my natural tremors. My pupils were always dialated as well.

I have been using the $T$ for 2 and half years now. I noticed during the first year I would spot lightly when I usually got my period and my cramps went away. After the first year my period pretty much went away for the most part. However, when I do occasionally get spotting, it lasts for about 2 weeks and it comes at random times.

The horrible side effects of $T$ were not worth it.

If you get a cold sore outbreak in your mouth. Don't walk, RUN to the nearest medical practitioner that can give you a prescription of $T$. Usually an outbreak would last me 3 weeks with just using over the counter creams. With the $T$, my mouth was back to normal after 4 days.Loved it!

I can only review the insertion as I have just gotten $T$ today. I am in my tewties and have never had a child or iud. I was prepared for the worst, but in reality it was about 30 seconds of discomfort, followed by a few hours of light cramping. No actual pain, and insertion was not accompanied by bleeding.

I took this antibiotic $T$ the second time I had a UTI. I had a quantity of 28 pills, but I was only meant to take 14 in a course of 7 days. So, after my forteenth pill, my UTI symptoms never stopped. So I took the fifteenth pill. Immediately, I broke out in hives and rashes all over my body. The rash was so violent and itchy, I had to go to the emergency room where they gave me an IV with saline, benadryl, and steriods to help with my allergic reaction!worst product!

I was given this mediation $T$ 6 years ago. I had a lot of problems like fibromyalgia, migraines, depression, insomnia, IBS -C. When I was first $T$ at 25mg I could sleep for the first time in years. I was waking up on the morning refreshed and happy. I noticed later my migraines were not as often as I normally would have them. This drug is a life saver. My fibromyalgia pain is less, migraines less, anxiety way less and it also improved my IBS C symptoms. I would recommend $T$ to anyone!!

I have been taking $T$ for MANY years. I started having weird feelings, like I was going to die, I kept ending up in the ER. The doctors kept telling me it was Anxiety. I DIDN'T understand why anxiety would make me feel this way. I have tried many, many anxiety medicines, Paxil, Effexor, Xanax, Lamictal, Geodon, and many more. NONE have worked the way $T$ works. With $T$ I feel safe and I do not get the jittery feelings. I am so grateful to have a medication that actually works for me!

I was prescribed $T$ to treat my sinus infection. It's been almost two days now and while I feel slightly better, the nausea and upset stomach is too much for me. I have eaten both yogurt or rice before taking it and I still get very sick. It is also making everything I eat seem extremely salty. Even when I breathe, I taste salt. Apparently this one is making my potassium levels rise too high.

Since being diagnosed with Epilepsy I was put on pills to prevent seizures which did not help until I was also put on $T$ and so far no seizures. I believe its related to a hormonal imbalance and the Birth Control definitely helps. I have not had any bad symptoms at all. No nausea, no mood swings. I have tried every single Birth Control I could think of and this is the only one I like by far.

Only thing I can say about the $T$ is AWESOME.  I have been on these pills for 6yrs now and in the beginning my period lasted 2 to 3 days and as time went on it decreased even more and went to 24hrs and my period was over.  Today, I haven't had a period at all I know in yrs. I love these pills!

It's amazing how many symptoms come about because of anxiety: chest pain, chest squeezing, dizziness, light-headed feelings, feeling faint, sweating, nausea, heart palpitations. I could go on. $T$ is practically a miracle drug. It stops most of these symptoms cold after about 45 minutes of taking it. You feel better, and you look back at one hour ago, and you're bewildered that stress and anxiety caused you to feel so badly.

I stumbled upon $T$ when my husband gave me one for muscle cramps. The effects were amazing!  I no longer felt trapped in my prison of isolation and misery. A word of caution though: this drug is addictive and should be taken in small amounts and withdrawal should be done slowly and under medical supervision. It is great!

Monistat

I was diagnosed with GAD and PD, and then given this generic brand of $T$. Since this drug more potent than other SSRIs, I was relying on its efficiency to work quickly and with little side effects. The first two weeks I noticed an improvement in my mood. But I was feeling drowsy (a side effect) that made me lack energy and feel too foggy headed. By the third week, I was experiencing an increase in anxiety, extreme mood fluctuations, stronger feelings of fear, lack of appetite, and more symptoms of a panic attack. I then quit the $T$. It just isn't for me.

They switched me from Necon to $T$ saying it was the same. Within the first week I knew it was bad for my body. My acne got worse and hurt, and my doctor said it should be helping my acne get better. Since I started 6 months ago with $T$ I have had dry eyes and now I have a hard time seeing far away, I'm stopping the pill completely now and I'm worried about side effects of going off but it's not worth the dry eyes and other bad side effects. Very disappointed!

I am very happy with $T$. Before I took this, I had a lot of trouble in school with paying attention and focusing, and after I took it, I noticed an immediate difference and it was so much easier to focus and pay attention. Another really positive feedback from $T$ is that it helps me engage in conversation more because I am more focused and I don't interrupt people like I used to. Also, it helps me think things through more.

I started $T$ ten weeks ago.  I was fine the first 6 weeks.  On week 7, I became extremely ill.  Vomiting, explosive diarrhea, gas pains and bloating like never before, long flatulence every few minutes (how embarrassing!), and sulfur-tasting belching (like rotten eggs).  Endo dr. told me to stop the injections.  It's been four weeks of suffering.  Not worth it!  This stuff is poison to me!

After taking $T$ for 6 months to relieve my panic, fear and irrational thoughts associated with my PTSD, I encountered very little relief. What I did gain was the WEIGHT. I gained fifty lbs in 6 months with no change in eating habits. After voicing this concern to my doctor, I was taken off the medication with no withdrawal effects and in ten months time I lost 49lbs with no exercise and eating a healthier low glycemic index diet.

I was on $T$ for 5 months as my first birth control ever, and overall I liked it. Shorter periods, less cramps, great skin, so cheap, and never any spotting. Only problem is I gained about fifteen pounds and my breasts got HUGE. Mine were already big and kept growing so I had to switch to a lower dose.  I would definitely recommend this birth control to anyone!

I've been taking $T$ for 4 months, and so far everything is going great.  I feel normal, my period comes on time every month, and my period is not as heavy.  Occasionally, I feel nauseous around my period, but that side-effect occurs with or without birth control. I would recommend this oral contraceptive to anyone who is between late teens and early twenties!

I started $T$ on Thursday morning because I had typhoid. My doctor insisted it will clear it and make me feel better.  Since Thursday,  I have experience extreme diarrhea,  nausea,   and body pains.  I wake up 8 -9 times during the night to vomit and stool.  Both happens simultaneously and as at this morning of the fourth day,  I feel like I might never get better. I am going to stop it. I have no more strength to even puke or sit up.

I took $T$ for about 3 years and the first two years I loved it. I have tried at least 4 birth controls (oral contraceptive form) and this one was the first to finally work for me. However, within the past year I had a weight gain of 7 pounds within a week have had so much hair loss this year now have 4 distinct bald spots. Otherwise works for me.

Ladies, please be smart and use BC and condoms! $T$ does not stop a pregnancy if egg fertilization has occurred.   I recently took a $T$ 24 hours after having sex, but it was too late. Take immediately if you suspect you might be pregnant an most importantly use all methods of BC!

I have been on $T$ for almost a month now. I have not experienced ANY side effects. Before I started it, I saw all these comments and they nearly scared me. My doctor assured me that if I had not felt any side effects on the birth control pills I was on before, that I would be fine. I was on Loestrin 24 FE before this one, but it started to not work for my period anymore. So far, not a problem with $T$!

$T$ was my default pain relief early in my experience with Ankylosing Spondylitis. It reduced inflammation and made the pain, discomfort and stiffness more manageable. I did experience some side effects like constipation, followed by diarrhea due to the blockage, stomach pains etc., but the pain management helped to make it bearable.

$T$ was the first medication I was put on. I was excited to start feeling better, but it made me feel awful. I suffer from extreme nausea before, during and after a migraine and it's completely life ruining. I've tried $T$ many times, in hopes of it finally working. Every time I'd take it, I'd get a horrible burning in my throat, and my migraine would worsen. It didn't help nausea, aura, pain or any other migraine symptoms I suffer from.

I am 22, no prior children, I have endometriosis was told $T$ was the best option. The implementation process was hell. The worst pain I have ever been in. Within those months I'd gained eighteen pounds, I was moody, had the worst cramps, hair loss, acne, horrible headaches, the appetite of a sumo wrestler, didn't want to do anything. I felt lazy and borderline depressed. They don't tell you those side effects for obvious reasons!

I take opiates every day, and a side effect of this is severe constipation. I would often go weeks without having a bowel movement. When I did go, it was painful and required a lot of work and time. I have tried other solutions and $T$ is the best by far. I took one cap full every day and on the second day I had a small bowel movement. I kept taking it and the very next day I had the first normal bowel movement in years. No cramping, no straining and no pain. I cannot recommend $T$ enough. It is so gentle, yet works so well!

I've been on $T$ for five months, and I can't wait to switch. I've noted breast tenderness, weird cramping, severe mood swings (laughing and crying at the same time while watching commercials; that was odd), my period doesn't occur in the normal cycle time, and I've gained a significant amount of weight. It probably works well with some women, but not for me.

I am 21 years old, non-smoker, do not drink often, exercise regularly. I recently got diagnosed with DVT (blood clot in leg) and a pulmonary embolism.  I was on $T$ and the 3 doctors I saw said it was due to the birth control.  DO NOT TAKE THIS!  I know it is considered a rare side effect, but it can happen to you easily.  Apparently it is not as rare as I thought.  The medication is VERY costly and you may have to be on blood thinners for the rest of your life. Be careful!

I've been on $T$ for 2 years, and symptoms have gotten worst.  I guess there's a reason the side effects make it so appealing to everyone.

I have been taking $T$ now for a little over twenty days. I am 32 years old and have suffered from chronic arthritis pain for over ten years. I have had two ankle surgeries leaving me with what feels like no relief. My last surgery was over 2 years ago and did provide SOME relief but not completely. Since I've been on $T$ I can honestly say it's been a blessing in disguise!!! I went from 2-3 days a week of pain and discomfort to virtually none.

I've been on $T$ for 9 months now. For the first three months I experienced nausea and occasional mood swings, it helped with making my period lighter and regularly on time. After the first months I was fine. Upon month 8 I experienced extreme mood swings and depression. I would pick fights about the smallest things and I felt crazy for doing so. I became really depressed once I hit month 9 and just could not figure out what was going on. Did not work for me!

After getting shot in my lower back, my back got torn apart. It took 7 surgeries, and the pain is unexplainable. My PM doctor put me on $T$ 4x daily,  and Oxycodone 30mg 6x daily. Now my pain level is about a 5/ten. Big improvement. It helps A LOT. I was first put on Fentanyl patch along with the Oxy, my pain then was 8/ten.. still too much pain. After getting switched to $T$ with the Oxy.. huge difference. $T$ is the best Painkiller I've ever tried!

Been on $T$ pills for 2 months No problems - at first had great sex drive, 4 day periods, no cramps, light. No headaches or mood changes like with other birth control pills. The pills are not expensive. Stopped taking it because my sugar got high and blood pressure was high. If you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure you shouldn't take it.

$T$ is too bad that doctors are so freaked out about addictive behavior to the point where they are willing to let people suffer.  Valium in low dose works and this is just junk.

I resent it when a person really needs help for acute conditions and they are given this kind of low performing medication!

The drug $T$ was used faithfully for three months for the treatment of sarcoidosis. My scalp was ozing, flaking and overwhelmed with hyperpigmented lesions.

One of the very first side effects of $T$ was spotting which I was ok with, but during the very first two months I experiences horrible cramping, way worse than the cramping of my usual period, I literally felt like my uterus was going to explode...it hurt that bad. $T$ caused me to be extra sensitive to everything and along with that on the 4th month of taking this I started to get hives all over my forehead. They were terribly itchy and nothing made them go away, even after I stopped taking it, it took months for it to go away!

Everyone reacts to drugs in different ways however I will never again take $T$ as I started feeling tired and got a bad headache the second day after taking it. That same night was even worse... I felt nauseous, my head hurt even worse, and all I could do was cry. I felt like I wasn't even in my own body. The medicine definitely messed with my head. It was the worst feeling ever.

$T$ does indeed work. Most who have given it a fair shake know the results and it is seen by reading the comments here. Most people who quit using it never gave it a real chance of working properly.

I've found $T$ helps to shrink the nasal passages to relieve some of the pressure, but not the headache the build up causes.  They should consider including acetometophine (sp) for the PAIN that the built up pressure can cause. Even with taking the $T$ and the pressure being released, the pain does not subside unless I take something for it.

$T$ is a Great medicine.  I take it only in the morning at a low dosage - it's a bit of an upper and helps my brain work better and faster. No side effects besides lunchtime headaches, a little extra clumsiness and mixing up words sometimes when I'm speaking or typing.

Amazing.  Yes, of course there were side effects.  I felt tired and a bit nauseous about an hour after taking the pill.  I countered this by taking the evening pill at night before bed and then I would be fine. $T$ works...if you really want to quit smoking.  It isn't magic and you do have to put some effort in. I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and I have not smoked for 10 weeks and have zero desire to do so.  It's truly a miracle medicine!

My son has been on $T$ for a year.  We started at 10mg, and are moving to 15 mg now.  It has (by far) been the best ADHD medicine we've tried. We have had pretty minimal skin irritation issues overall.  Sometimes the backing of the patch is hard to peel, but 15 seconds in the freezer solves that problem.  By far our favorite ADHD medicine.

No medication has gotten rid of all of my symptoms but $T$s is one of the best I've tried (and I have tried them all literally). I noticed the munchies on regular Zyprexa tabs but none on $T$....I have actually lost weight. I gave it a rating of 9 because I still have symptoms of schizoaffective disorder but high enough rating to give it kudos compared to other drugs.

When I say I have NEVER, EVER taken/applied any medication to my cold sores before that is as effective as $T$, I MEAN IT. I have been dealing with this virus forever and I have tried everything. My doctor gave me a prescription to have on hand and 3 weeks ago, as I was afraid to ask for it at the pharmacy. 2 days ago though, when I woke up with that infamous tingle I ran and filled it up. I messed up the dosage but once I caught up, it REALLY began to disappear. Its day 3 and I'm back to normal. Thank God for $T$! Try it.

I have tried heat pads, freeze pads, gels tablets and I am really pleased I saw these advertised on the TV I tried $T$ and I had no expectations at all.

I wish more than anything i never inserted this devil cream $T$ inside my body in the first place. This is night one for me, and I'm just going to tough out the YI and not use it again. EVER. I can't do another night of this. The mild itching I had before is NOTHING compared to the itching I have now. If there were sandpaper near me, I would use it. Repeatedly. Inside and out. I can feel my heart beating in my vagina. That's the pain I'm feeling!

I am a 40yr old female.  I have had acne since I was 13.  I noticed bumps all over my forehead for years along with a large cystic pimple a couple times a year.  6 weeks ago my dermatologist prescribed $T$ along with 2 antibiotics.  This has been the perfect trifecta of treatment!  My forehead has not been this clear since I was a a kid and my skin is significantly less greasy.  Highly recommend!!

This year my insurance changed and the pharmacy issued $T$.  I thought it'd be fine since it has the the exact same amount of NORETHINDRONE.  Wow, was I wrong!  Luckily I only got a three month supply because I am quitting this pill. In two and half months on $T$ , I've had a period or bleeding every 5-7 days.  It's not just bleeding, I get the whole deal; cramps, lower back pain, hunger cravings, crankiness, and bloating.My skin has broken out, I've been super irritable/moody, and I don't understand how the side effects can be so extreme for me!

Began using $T$ when I was maybe 16 or 17. Either way I'm 22 now and am happy with my body and its cycle. I get my period usually on time every 4 weeks (28 days). I do cramp, but lighter than off OC. I have never been pregnant to my knowledge, and I wouldn't say I'm remotely good with taking it on time or every day. $T$ is very reliable in my opinion, I would recommend it to someone interested or looking at BC.

$T$ has been decent. I have definitely seen a cut back in my oil production and acne on my neck, however I have been getting breakouts on my cheeks and forehead and I never really did before. I don't see much of a difference other than less oil. My acne location just pretty much relocated.

I started $T$ 4 months ago right before I left for college in August. The first month was okay. I was happy as ever at college. I got horrible cramps when I got my first period on it and my period was really irregular but I figured I just needed to adjust. Come late October, November, and now December have been the worst months of my life. I'm crying every day, lost my boyfriend, planned on started therapy, don't want to go back to school, nothing makes me happy I want to do nothing at all times. everybody's body is different but this depression isn't even worth risking. Do not take this!

I have had a wonderful experience with $T$ ! I have had zero side effects, Its been great! I honestly cant say anything bad about any IUD I think they are awesome. Pills are old news this is a new generation for women who cant take control of are bodies and choose when we are ready for babies.

I have cramps now and get daily headaches.. I truly believe it's from $T$ patches. I will finish this month then maybe go to minastrin which is less estrogen.. I haven't decided yet. I would love to just do natural family planning, side effects aren't worth it.

The first two days of taking $T$, I experienced body aches all over, headaches, thus, I took aspirin in the evening to try to alleviate the pain.  The third day and beyond, I felt/feel more energized, no headaches, no backaches, mental clarity, and just relieved.  I say you have to give $T$ time to kick in and get in your system. I am thankful.

$T$ control seemed fine at first, but 10 days into it I started feeling not like myself--bad mood swings, feeling breathless or winded even when sitting, my blood pressure would spike for no reason, and I felt extremely sluggish.  One day I even had mild heart attack symptoms.  My body definitely did not react well to this medication.

I am a 28 yr old male who was very fortunate and never had acne as a kid or throughout my college years. Around my 27th birthday I started breaking out. Initially, it was not to bad and I thought it was stress from growing up and dealing with adult issues. However, it kept getting worse. I went to a dermatologist and I was put on $T$ and it is great. I stuck with it and now my face is clear. The main thing for new users is to know that it will not work overnight and will prob get worse before it gets better. Stay with it."

I love $T$!! I take this pill and was so scared of being on birth control due to side effects of weight gain and mood swings but I've had absolutely no symptoms at all with this pill. Definitely recommend since it has given me no negative side effects at all. As long as it stays effective I will continue to use $T$, so glad I found a reliable birth control!

I've had the $T$ IUD twice.. First time around I had it in for 5 months and had It removed due to pain after sex every time. I loved it though no hormones regular periods! So I ended up getting it placed again a year later and this time around is amazing! No pains after or during sex I honestly don't even feel it it's almost as if it's none existent! And my periods are heavier first 2 days and crampier again only the first 2 days. So far this has been my fav BCM of all ! Really recommend!

It's a life saver for me.  Chronic sinus problem that occurs twice a year.  Slight stomach issues after initial dose.  Knocks out brain fog.  Had the best night sleep in months.  Always take with food, and you will have no issues.  Made me feel 90% better 24 hours after initial dosage.  Use with Flonase to open passages to help get it all.  Only thing that works for my sinus problems!

$T$ gave me the worst experience of my life. It made me sleepy, yes. But at the same time, It sped up my mental discomfort, and it made my muscles jump. Similar to restless leg syndrome, but throughout my entire body. It was so bad they had to reverse it with Benadryl to alleviate the symptoms, And finally they gave me a mixture of Valium and Demerol to put me in a twilight state until it passed. If you have ANY medication allergies, even mild. I would strongly advise against this medication!

After started using $T$ I had horrible hormonal changes and mood changes, I gained almost 50 pounds very quickly after getting the implant inserted.  This birth control is UP TO 3 years, after two and a half years I got pregnant. I knew it had worn off because I lost weight and felt more like myself. But I ended up having a miscarriage from the implant before I could get it removed. Horrible product!

I was on $T$ years 9 years ago for social anxiety and it worked great for me. I decided to get off it but slowly all my symptoms came back. Also got very depressed. Got back in $T$ 7 months ago and I feel great again. I did have to get a night guard from my dentist. I chipped two from teeth and cracked a molar from grinding my teeth. 200mg daily.

I have been on $T$ for a week now with no side affects. I watch what I eat and stay away from carbs and sugars. I will be getting married in June and have been trying to loose weight since last summer by following the SOS diet very strictly and going to the gym 4 times a week and not much change. So far I am down 3 lbs. in week one. I'm hopeful for the first time in a long time!!!

$T$ is a LIFESAVER. My boyfriend and I had un protective sex. So within 4 hours after the incident, I took the pill. I was paranoid as hell, not sure whether this pill would work or not ( my first time taking it and I am also young). I experienced mild cramping , head aches and nausea for five days. But my period came on time ! The key is to stay calm and let the pill do its job.

It worked okay for my back pains, but during the time that I first started taking it I got a really bad sore throat and if it wasn't for $T$, I would not have been able to get out of bed.  My throat felt so bad that I could hardly talk or eat and drink, but after taking the $T$, it took the pain away for about 3 to 4 hours before I had to take another.  Therefore, if you have a bad sore throat or any inflammatory conditions try it!

$T$ did a good job reducing my symptoms dramatically. However, it gave me so much in return, which made my life complicated! I mean 50 lb weight gains over a year that keeps growing every month. I also cannot sleep at night as I could before. I see very vivid dreams and nightmares almost every night! It makes me wake up feeling tired. In addition, I had withdrawal symptoms when I once forgot to take my dose. Worst decision!

I thought I would try $T$ instead of going to get a prescription this time. I have been using it for 3 weeks and it does absolutely nothing to help curb your appetite, if anything, I seemed to eat more. So I thought I would try taking more than the suggested, well that did nothing either. $T$ was a big waste of money for me and I will just have to go and get a prescription again, which does work.

I started on $T$ due to severe medicine sensitivities.  This has been a lifesaver.  I am currently on 2.5 mg and feel so much better.  My doctor would like me to get to 5mg, I will, but it will be slowly.  There is no one size fits all as far as dosage goes.  If you're sensitive to medicines, think about $T$.  Easier to control dosages, minimal side effects.  Wonderful!

In one sense $T$ handled many of my symptoms, but I became a completely different person. I was no longer myself at all. I made many, many horrible decisions affecting my family friends, business, etc. I adopted a whole new set of values - i just wasn't myself anymore. When I finally decided to go off it I spent 9 months of withdrawal symptoms, splitting capsules every day and gradually reducing the amount of grains.

$T$ completely worked as a birth control. Even if I forgot to take it for a couple days, I never had a pregnancy. But the past 2 1/2 years i started to break out badly and I would feel a pain in the opening of my vagina during sex.

Was prescribed $T$ while in the US Virgin Islands, for UTI. Doctor prescribe me 7 days worth two pills each day. I've been taking the prescribed dose and have not felt much better except for one full the day before yesterday. I'm back in the States now and I'm continuing to take the medication since you should not start taking your antibiotics unless your doctor tells you to but I am going to go to my family doctor tomorrow and figure out why I'm now peeing blood and have small bloody deposits when I urinate.

Been on $T$ for 4 weeks now at 30 mg. I was prescribed Cymbalta for migraines and general anxiety. Week 2 started to feel more normal but my anxiety was worse (to be expected). Week 3 I  noticed my migraines were less frequent and I tolerated the pain better, also started feeling happier and less anxious. Week 4 my anxiety is almost gone n migraines have gone from daily to maybe every 3 or 4 days and are less severe. Worth the first two weeks of feeling crappy.

All I have to say is UGH. I've been on $T$ for about 2 weeks now and I am totally not myself. I feel so sad and depressed. I have also had random crying spells. Appetite hasn't increased at all but my skin has broken out. My skin has been super itchy all over since I've been on it and I've been getting stomach pains and headaches.

It's day 6 on $T$ the side effects are really kicking I'm nauseous to the point where I think I'm pregnant and have to vomit, my headaches are increasing but I only have one more day so I think I can hang in there. Overall my symptoms of bv are gone but the medicine just makes me sick

Took $T$ for about 4 years and had throat swelling, feeling like something wrapped around my neck, swallowing issues and hoarseness. I  stopped using it for two years and as my COPD worsened my doc put me back on it. Bang those symptoms came right back. I am now on Tudorza and doing better without those side effects.

I developed eczema when I turned 70. I started $T$ with my initial dose 9 days ago. After about 3 days I thought it was working because my itching subsided about 50 %. However I am sad to say that my condition has flared up again. I will continue treatment for 1 to 2 months and reassess but so far I am deeply disappointed.

$T$ is so phenomenal !! I put on weight fast, you start to see and feel results so quickly !!!

When you first start $T$, it is a wonder drug.  At some point, you will either need more, or you will suffer from tolerance withdrawals.  There are justifiable horror stories about this drug. Taking it for a week or two, no problem.  More than 2 weeks, it's hard to get off it.  I have been weaning off for about 4 months.

I have always been vulnerable to bronchitis and pneumonia.  This antibiotic $T$ is the only thing that works.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth yes but I know that after 10 days I will be done and better.  Before I was prescribed this, I would often have to take more then 10 days of antibiotics in order to get better.

I was just diagnosed in my 40s with generalized anxiety disorder not surprised.  I was always having anxiety/panic attacks and unable to function some times.  I now take $T$ daily and while it takes about 2 months to really kick in my anxiety is gone and I feel FAR beyond how I have felt in forever. Highly recommend it at 10mg if not feeling better!

Worst decision ever!! Got $T$ after 6wks postpartum thinking it was the most convenient birth control method. Oh, so wrong. Got it 4-17-15, started bleeding 5-1-15, a month after I am still bleeding. Terrible mood swings. Increased cravings for sweets and junk food, dizziness, very tired and sleepy. Well its a horror story. I am not going back for a 2nd shot, no way. I will never get another shot of $T$ that transformed me in to a non stop bleeding witch.

I started $T$ today. At only 0.6 mg. I felt so undeniably and utterly  unwell that I cannot imagine even trying it for a second day. In summary, severe low blood sugar symptoms,  ravenously hungry  and I was also prescribe this for weight loss as well as diabetes,  headache, no energy, and a general feeling of being very not well. In short I do not recommend this to anyone!

After 13 years of untreated depression, anxiety and panic attacks I decided to finally ask for help. That came in the form of 10mg $T$ for the first week, 20mg for another month and boosted up to 30mg for the next few months. In that time I had nothing but bad side effects. Instead of feeling depressed and sad I just got grumpy and mad. My partner told me I had changed since starting the $T$.

I starting taking $T$ 8 weeks ago. I was extremely stressed out and was suffering from PTSD due to a bad car accident. After about 1 1/2 wks I really noticed a difference. Not stressed anymore but I do feel a bit Zombie like. I also have a problem with memory and focusing. Also really tired at night. Overall right now I guess it is worth the trade off. Also have intestinal issues but hope it will go away.

It does however work very well with few side effects and I wake up feeling refreshed.

I'm taking $T$ to regulate my period. This is my 2nd month and I've experienced loss of appetite, stomach ache, nausea/vomitting the most...I've actually lost 10 pounds which is awesome. The neasea/vomitting is only about once a week so it's not that bad...I just am not hungry anymore...which helps me make better choices in eating. My first month I was hormonal, however now I think my bodies gotten use to it so I'm not as hormonal.

I've had the $T$ for over 2 years and I absolutely love it.  The only issue I've had with it is my periods are very irregular which is no big deal for me. I get a period for 2 weeks and then I'm period free for about 4 months, then it will return. I have no problem with that. I plan on using this birth control method for 5 more years. I love it!

I've been on $T$ for a year and half and I've had a regular cycle twice! I get it early and it lasts 7-12 days, and it's just brown, not a true period. Recently I've started to get the bad acne everyone mentions. I'm 43 and have pimples on my chin and forehead (never had it before). It has eliminated my breast tenderness and cramping though - that's why I strayed on it. But it's just too unpredictable and so I changed to another birth control. I do not recommend it!

$T$ made me unable to BREATHE!!!  As soon as I took one, about 30 minutes later came a cough episode from hell, with my throat closing up. Thought maybe it was cold air. Took another one. Same thing. This time chest tightness and burning. I went to another urgent care where they gave me a breathing treatment and a z pack for suspected bacterial bronchitis. I came home and told my man I think it was a side effect of the meds. He said let me take one. 30 minutes later he had a migraine from hell and a fever. DON'T TAKE THIS TRASH!!!

Wrapping up week 8 with $T$. First depression treatment attempt, therefore unable to compare to similar drugs.

I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS $T$ AGAIN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  It began with headaches, which got worse every time I took the it.  My energy level went down to nothing, and it did not help my RA at all.  NOW, $T$ has given me severe Eczema on my hands, feet, underarms, crotch and in my ear canals.  I have never been so miserable in my entire life.  They can't help the eczema at all.  I have gone off Humira for over 2 months, I'm flaring, and I still have the eczema. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

I've been using $T$ for 1 week. I think the use of putting perfume in the gel is really stupid. There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it's just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.

I'm bipolar and $T$ is the only medication (out of many, many) that really helps my bipolar and it works almost instantaneously for me.

I did gain weight and I eat tons, but I have a good metabolism and $T$ just brings me up to my medically ideal weight.

I started taking this after I had a child at age 17, and first, the side effects were minimum for me but I got a lot of weird bumps all over my hands that looked like warts, and the doctor said that I either had to wait them out or stop the pill. After 3 months they finally went away.  I took this for about a year. My husband and I have tried for the last 20 months to get pregnant, and it turns out now I'm all of a sudden infertile.

Honestly, I felt better about 4 hours after begging treatment with $T$ for an infected/abcessed tooth. Surprisingly quick, considering the amount of pain I was in.  The downside, for me at least, seems to be slight nausea/dizziness.  I had taken ibuprofen earlier due to pain, so this meant bad times in front of the toilet.

I used $T$ on some sore joints (and a tennis elbow). It worked as well as anything I have ever tried. I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck.  When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders.  The headache never developed.  Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best.  $T$ is now my standard treatment for these headaches.

I got my $T$ inserted in the month of Janaury 2015, and it was very painful. I had my period for probably a month and spotting a little for 2 weeks. I don't think I had any emotional changes, i was pretty much myself. But so far my $T$ has done wonders. I have not had a period or any spotting until today.

$T$ worked wonders on me. I have taken this medicine for 3 almost 4 years now I used to not be able to eat. After I started this medicine I was able to eat a lot more. This worked wonders on me. Also this didn't work on me at first until my doctor put me on this 2X daily.

I was prescribed $T$ for a bacterial skin infection under my arm. I get infections easily and am often on all kinds of antibiotics. Many bother me, but I have not had any problems at all while on $T$. And the skin infection has been clearing up very well. I'm very happy with this medication!

Horrible drug. $T$ is garbage. I've been on the majority of these psych drugs. Pure poison. Now that the horrible withdrawal effects are lessening--I'm getting much better. While on and coming off them, it was pure hell. Thats my experience.

All depends on the individual I actually found that $T$ made my seizures WORSE. I started taking it and was fine for 2 years with no side affects, no seizures, nothing, then 1 day I had a massive grand Mal seizure the doctors keep upping my dose. Now I am on the maximum dose but still having seizures. Before I took $T$ I had only a few fits in my life now I have them about once every couple of weeks.

After using $T$ I felt a difference right away. The only negative feedback I have is the tiredness. I can't stay awake but I do not know if it is from coming off of ADD medication. I have been on $T$ for 3 days now and already feel like a new woman!

$T$ definitely makes you go but omg the nausea is awful. I didn't throw up but I couldn't even talk or move in bed because I had to concentrate so hard not to throw u . The stomach pain is really awful. Comparison is to like the stomach flu. I've been taking laxatives for years and never have I felt this before. Especially after reading all these reviews I know I'm not the only one. Too intense. Like....damn I wanted a BM but not to get the flu with it geez

$T$ is saving my life right now. Its a shame the people who abuse it ruin it for those of us who get relief from debilitating issues from it, because many doctors just don't want to prescribe it now. I say what's the point of having a drug if you can't use it to help people who need it.

After giving birth, lay up in a hospital bed and taking all kinds of medicines. $T$ is the best way to get the well needed relief. For me, it doesn't cause any of that rumbling you get with laxatives. Thanks.

I switched from Risperidal to $T$ two years ago.  On 15mg and it works much better for me. On Risperidal my symptoms (paranoia) still poked through, but not anymore.  Also the side effects are a lot less present.  I still sleep about 10 hours though. Otherwise my functioning is high.

I had $T$ put in Feb 2015. I am 31, no kiddos, I went to work immediately after getting Skyla put in. I took 2 Aleve and the pain/severe cramps were gone. I had my first period for 17 days straight. One week no period. Then 2 more weeks of period. Eventually getting lighter and lighter but still the full 7 days. Side effects are acne, gained 15lbs, moody and no cramping.

I got the shot of $T$ about 2 and a half months ago. I have not stopped bleeding/ spotting from the first day i got it, not even for a day. Im a surgeons first nurse, so im on my feet all day, and every now and again i get cramps along with it. My Dr did tell me that the irregularities would be stopping after another dose or 2, which mean i would have to wait about 3- 6 months to some see dry panties. NO.

I had 40+ injections of 200 units of $T$ for migraine approximately two and a half weeks ago. The first few days were horrible, as they made my migraines worse. Now my migraines have reduced (which is awesome), but I have horrible pain in my arms and hands that I've never experienced before. My forearm muscles won't flex, so somehow the toxin spread rather far away. My mouth is extremely dry as well and I have difficulty swallowing. The pain in my arms is unbearable at times. I do not recommend $T$ at all, despite the reduction in migraines. I will never get this again.

I acquired a Staph infection after rotator cuff surgery. It was as painful if not more painful as shingles. Have been taking $T$ for 14 days with 3 to go. It has worked to heal the sores. The problem is the constant stomach upset and nausea. It is a very unpleasant feeling. Somewhat like sea sickness.

I took $T$ for 8months, too many side effects, numb emotional feelings and made anxiety worse , feeling aggressive, aching joints,big changes in weight and bodily functions , not easy to withdraw from either, worsening thoughts, or you'll end up back on it. My opinion is never again, beware!

Using $T$ for a week. If you can imagine restlessness and extreme sleepiness at the same time, horrible. Walking around in my apartment shaking my arms and legs while being so sleepy and tired was miserable but I have since read that if you are taking medication for seratonin uptake inhibitors that it could cause that so I think it was a side effect. Still ......miserable , so make sure what you are taking with it and discuss with your doctor concerns about drug interactions."

Getting better results than with Lantus.  Used Lantus for 7 years.  I have used $T$ for 1 year as of April 2016.  Did not experience any adverse side effects.  Blood sugar much more stable - not as many highs or lows.  Makes it easier to do fine-tuning with my mealtime insulin.

I have been on $T$ for two weeks now. Honestly, IT'S NOT WORKING!  I take with food, I have nausea, I get tired, (the first day, I was so sleepy), dizzy, afternoon hunger, still crave for carbs in the middle of the day, headaches, stomach pain, and now that I take one at night too,  I understand,  after reading some comments, why I have being having weird dreams. I have an appointment with my doctor coming March because she told me $T$ can increase my blood pressure and she wants to monitor very close.  I also feel bad about the price, Not worth!

During the ten days on $T$ I was emotional, my boobs hurt severely, my face broke out like crazy, and I had horrible fatigue. Having to change my pad/ tampon every single hour was disgusting, I couldn't even enjoy a shower because even afterward I still bled non stop. Each day that passes, the heavier my period gets. Today is my 6th day, heavy as hell, but 5,6 had excruciating cramps. And too many blood clots! I do not recommend this pill at all!

I've been on $T$ for 18 months 100mg. It took 4 to 5 weeks to help me have a relaxed outlook on life. I still have a lot of the side effects you are all talking about. If I forget to take $T$ for a day or two I fall straight back to the place I was.

I just wanted to say as someone who suffered immensely because of $T$, the reviews here regarding other peoples experiences has been a great comfort to me as I now know I am not alone nor am I crazy for having felt it. The sheer, true panic this drug caused me is completely indescribable. Within moments of having taken it, I experienced the most insane panic attack of my life. I don't even know if you can describe it as simply a panic attack because it was so much more and so much worse than that. I nearly ripped the IV out of my arm.

After taking $T$ 150mg a day I felt some relief from depression, anxiety and adhd. My MD thought I should see a psychiatrist and would not increase my dosage. I went online and found that the proper dosage for me should be 300 mg a day.  As a duplicate bridge player my performance went from last to an astounding first place finish yesterday. Listen to your doctor but do your own research.

I quit abusing medicines and drinking 2 1/2 years ago, but never thought I would quit smoking. I started taking $T$ January 17, and have been cigarette free since January 24!

Taking $T$ was an awful experience. Everything was going fine until right around the time that I started the second month of it- and since then, I have had nasty breakthrough bleeding ever since then!

I'm on low carb diet (Atkins) - and am deep into ketosis, no carb cravings, and eating about 2,500 calories a day!

$T$ straight up works. I'm a 27 year old who has performance anxiety issues, and this stuff is a life saver. Don't listen to those who say it doesn't help with psychological issues; it really does! My only two complaints are the cost, and ironically, sometimes it's TOO easy to get an erection!

I was prescribed to take $T$ twice a day for 7 days for bacterial vaginosis. I will never allow a doctor to prescribe me this ever again!! The taste comes from nightmares for starters, and good LORD the side effects are NOT worth it!! Constant nausea, dizziness, everything tastes like fecal matter, fevers, restlessness, overall weak and uncomfortable. This cannot be good for you. I didn't even have any side effects with the BV itself, Its this medication that has been making me feel like death!

I was on $T$ for Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder. After about a year of being on it it started to make me feel like a complete zombie. I had zero motivation for anything which reflected in my grades and I'm normally an obsessive overachiever in school.. I just kind of let myself go. I wasn't depressed but I wasn't happy, it just put me in this fog-like feeling. I couldn't eat or sleep, I had cold sweats, nausea/vomiting, and I had anxiety like never before. It was truly a nightmare.

Lots of trouble sleeping and lots of anxiety with $T$.  It also makes me a bit depressed.  Better if you can take it in the morning instead of later at night.  Works, but there is probably something with less side effects that works just as well.  Usually given this for sinus infections, this is the first time for cystitis.

We used $T$ during our trip in Tanzania. To tell the truth, we were afraid of some bad comments about this drug. In fact, nothing happened to us. We were taking it every day after our breakfast, so as to avoid an upset stomach. I think that, for malaria, $T$ is a very safe and without serious side effects.

I was getting food stuck n my throat ended up n the hospital they put a balloon down n my chest stretched it open a little, put me on $T$ it really helps with no side affects that I can tell but if I go over 4 or 5 days without taking it I'll get choked on food but I read u should only take this med for 14 days a time.  I have taken 1 for 2 years every morning if I miss for a few days I start getting choked on food again should I keep on taking it? I guess either that or choke to death

$T$ is just marvelous! I can eat ice cream without heating it.  It's a  great product that I highly recommend. I've tried many of the other prescription options available and this is by far the best.  It needs some good marketing to spread the good word about how it can help people.

I first started using $T$ about 6 months ago when I had a very bad flare-up of colitis.  I was told to use the fresh root which I placed in my blender with a teaspoon of honey.  The inflammation started disappearing and in no time there was no bleeding or mucous.  You should take $T$ twice daily until symptoms clear up, then take intermittently. I stopped taking after a while and symptoms started even with meds, but I have now re-started it and feel a lot better.  $T$ is a Godsend.

Well at first I did like $T$ as a long term contraception option, the side effects were unbearable, and I ended up having it removed after only one year. The main side effect that was bothersome was the daily spotting. The spotting ranged from a heavy period flow to a smaller lighter flow. However, it was EVERY SINGLE DAY. Other side effects included a weight gain of 10 pounds and unexpected mood swings. I immediately felt 100% better after having it removed.

I was calm and collected after that. I've been on it ever since, I take every couple of days when I'm anxious along with Neurontin 300mg, 3 times a day. Definitely helps with the anxiety, I would recommend this to everyone.

Although $T$ completely alleviated all of the symptoms of psychosis, my mom experienced severe joint stiffness, cramping, muscle pain and weakness.

This is the second time I've had $T$ within a two year time period. The first time, after a few months, I had a really bad itch that would never go away. It has gotten so bad to the point that I would bleed and leave myself in pain every night. I tried just about everything to get rid of the itch but the only effective thing was removing the it. I just recently got it implanted again in January and the exact same thing is happening. Wasn't quite sure at first but now I'm more than positive that its a bad side effect of the implant. Total discomfort and wouldn't recommend to anyone.

I love $T$. I don't have to worry about a pill every day. I don't have periods. It last for 5yrs. All my friends have fears about it because everyones body is different. But I haven't had any trouble with mine and I have had it for 4yrs now.

I have been on $T$ medication for over 3 years. I finally found a medicine that really takes my anxiety away when I have my attacks. It has greatly allowed me to be myself again. Much better then anything else I have ever tried. My Doctor prescribed me $T$ along with 1 mg of clonazepam and I sleep very well considering my previous condition.

I started $T$ six months ago and I got my life back. I initially had an upset stomach for one week, which was relieved with food. No other side effects. After four weeks I felt good and after eight weeks I returned to myself. I had been diagnosed with severe treatment  resistant  depression for 2 1/2 years. I had tried all medications from different classes. I would highly recommend this  drug. Life saver.

I have been given $T$ through an IV on several occasions and on all those occasions I'd rather just dealt with the pain. Today the hospital gave me $T$, and some nausea medication... On ever occasion that I have been given it through IV instantly my head gets too heavy, I begin to get dizzy and lighthead. I always get VERY NAUSEOUS and confused, so I usually sleep it off  because I hate the feeling it gives me. This time was different I fell asleep about 40 minutes after getting the medication and every couple minutes I kept waking up. All of a sudden I became very hot and clamy while feeling very cold.

My Don started taking $T$ and started to complain that he could not see the board at school. At first I figured well maybe he is just a kid who needs glasses. His prescription was very low. So I took him back to the doctor and they could not correct his vision with the strongest prescription. Everything is blurry and out of focus, he lost all peripheral vision on both eyes. The doctors first question was What medication is he on? So I told him and he advised me to immediately go to the doctor who prescribed it because it is a severe side effect of Focalin. Grrrr"

Because of an auto accident a year ago I had a partial separation of my right sacroiliac joint. I've taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. $T$ is the only medication I've taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.

I had bad rls. It went up my arms and down my legs .I am on $T$ 300mg once a day and trazodone 50mg at night. The trazodone seemed to make it worse. did nothing to help the restlessness .  As soon as I was prescribed $T$, I felt better. 300mg x5 a day.  I would recommend this drug for anyone with rls.

Started $T$ at 10 mg up to 25mg. Doesn't help pain but I do sleep better. Extremely dry mouth and skin since I began 2 months ago. Not sure if the sleep is worth the sore dry mouth and skin that when I rub  it, snows dead skin cells everywhere.

I suffered with RA for over 15 years in most of my joints.  6 years ago I moved to a new state and started with a new RA doctor.  She started me on $T$ and lowered the dosage of methotrexate.  I have been pain free for the past 6 years.  Love my doctor and $T$.

Ive had the $T$ for more than a year now. I'm a very young mom and decided to get the it as soon as possible (Which is 6 weeks after giving birth). I heard many horror stories but I knew this was one of my only options. Im glad I went with my gut instinct, I absolutely LOVE the $T$. It has been completely safe and I have had no bad side effects!

I started taking $T$ going on 3 weeks ago and I think its great.  The side effects that I suffered in the very beginning were headaches but they are all pretty much gone. I also did not put on any additional weight. I actually lost about 4 pounds. It seems to suppress my appetite. I highly recommend it!

I've been taking $T$ for 6-7 years now and I think its time for a change for me. It stopped working for me in the past 1 year (my anxiety has come back). I also never liked the side effects, mainly: leg muscle spasms at night, easily electrically shocked, and drowsiness.

I had the $T$ put in 5 weeks after my son was born and well as far birth control it was great. Now the side effects was my arm would randomly hurt I gained a ton of weight and my periods where way out of whack. its a 50/50 thing for me.

$T$ works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe. Tts an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.

$T$ is terrible. I took the medication for several months, and was miserable the entire time. I was noticeably irritable and extremely anxious. I stopped taking the medication and switched back to ortho tri cyclen lo and the problems went away. I am currently waiting to receive information on my new insurance, and ran out of ortho. I had an extra pack of tri lo sprintec and decided to give it another try. I regret this, because just a few days into the medication, I am once again anxious, grumpy, and miserable.

I just started taking $T$. I am a 16 year old male suffering from severe social anxiety. I was never like this before a of couple months ago. Anyway I started taking it about 5 days ago. At first my anxiety got worse. But today I didn't feel all that bad and just hoping it gets better from here. We will see. Also only side effects. Slight headache here and there.

Taken $T$ for 2 months. Hate it. Side effects are awful! HEADACHE, LOSS OF ENERGY, BONE/JOINT PAIN, RINGING IN EARS, NUMBNESS/TINGLING OF HANDS and TOES, LIGHT HEADED, CONFUSION, VISUAL ISSUES, SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT, COUGH, MUSCLE PAIN,STOMACH ACHE, TOO MUCH TO LIST. Does bring pressure down but may not last 24 hours. After 3 weeks my bp was finally lower than 140/90 in the mornings. Next appointment I'm off this drug. Can't take it!

I have struggled with anxiety/depression/insomnia my whole life. Nothing ever had any noticeable effects until I was prescribed $T$ back in 2007. I was on it for years, then decided to try life without it and was tapered off. The thing about $T$ (and all antidepressants) is they work well in that you wont spend as much time crying and all that but they also inhibit you from feeling genuine euphoria! You just stay at a base-line.

I used $T$ for my bronchitis. It really helped me get better faster, it even got rid of the few zits I had. The downfall is after I was done with my prescription I broke out all over! My face, neck, and chest are all covered in acne or its a rash, I'm not sure... I've never had bumps this bad in my entire life!

The first couple of weeks, $T$ seemed to help, but then I developed a bad case of thrush, even though I rinsed and gargled after each use.  I did not swallow it. I have had the 5 pills to suck on every day for 14 days and now the Nystatin to swish, gargle and swallow. I am much better now, but I took myself off it!

My 10-year son has ADHD (combined) and ODD. $T$ so far is the only medication that works on my sons inattentiveness. However, on 15 mg he was very moody and glassy eyed. Found out later that he was overmedicated. I am considering putting him back on $T$ with a lower dose.

48 years old, and my Doctor has recently prescribed me $T$ because intercourse was becoming unbearable. Very painful and I was tearing! Geez! So far, the pain and dryness seems to be decreasing, as I've been only using the creme for the past month. I have no side effects at all so far. Thats a good thing! However, I do find the creme very expensive!

I was prescribed $T$ a few days ago after having a severe panic attack. After explaining my family history to the doctor he concluded that my anxiety was probably caused by an underlying depression/ slight bipolar disorder that was never diagnosed or treated. As much as I tried to wish I was normal and denied having the same issues as many of my family members I just have to accept that I have inherited that gene. I am still nervous about being on medicines but I am hoping it helps to get my emotions under control.

Wow! I LOVE this medicine $T$! I am excited about the hope of bigger breast, aren't we all ladies? It apparently has increased my sex drive. I am 35 years of age, married for 18 years and have 5 children. I cannot say anything bad at all about this medication, I love it! Oh yeah, it regulates my periods so as I have them more often with less cramps, I also have lighter periods, which is always a plus.

Since the age of 11 I suffered with cystic acne and later in life I had cysts on my face, chest, back and breasts, and inner thighs. Constant blood and drainage of pus was a regular everyday event for me. After being prescribed $T$ my life changed. It was like a miracle! Later in life I was put on the generic form and was not pleased at all. It did nothing.

I have been on $T$ 4 days 5mg and found I have nausea and feel very restless and more anxiety I also have the a strange feeling in my leg not sure whether to keep going with medication. My heart feels like it is racing but that could be from the anxiety. Not sure I can rate this so early in taking it.

My life before this god send medicine was awful agitated, stressed with no reason, light depressed I couldn't think straight. 2 months of taking $T$ felt it  relieved all. Please all IBS suffers I know what painful IBS are and embarrassing. please don't give up try this you wouldn't feel relieved for awhile may be 1 or 2 or 3 months  but it will work - don't give up. I hope IBS suffers find this helpful for them.

Ive been on $T$ since January (it is now July) and sadly I've developed cystic acne from it. If I would've realized sooner that it was the culprit, I would've stopped immediately. I took this pill in the first place for my acne only. I was someone who had moderate acne and this cystic acne has made me so depressed. I also read reviews that said your skin would get used to it before it got better and that wasn't true for me at all. Save yourself before it gets worse definitely. Wish I could put pictures of my acne here!

Ive been on $T$ for 4 months, 2 shots 1 time a month and now as I approach my 5 month. Doctor is talking about decreasing my Advair. I currently take 500 of Advair and have not had to use my rescue inhaler in a very long time. I was diagnosed with COPD about 6 years ago, but my symptoms have totally reversed themselves and I am doing very well. The Doctor tells me that I may only get down to 100 of Advair but I think my asthma is doing great. $T$ is a great medicine.

I have been taking 50 mg of $T$ for 5 years and my blood pressure recently became very variable.  At times it was very well controlled but then it would spike.  I took it for three days and developed several side effects including dizziness, vision changes, mild chest pain, severe constipation and both upper and lower abdominal pains.  Doctor said  stop it. i checked my diary and sure enough I'd been having severe constipation and abdominal pain last time I took it.

My doctor put me on $T$ in hopes of clearing up a mild but reoccurring skin infection under my arms. I was instructed to take 2 pills per day for 2 weeks.  My first, second and third day I felt okay, but the fourth - ninth day (today) I have felt very tired, shaky and dizzy.  When I turn my head a certain way, or lay down, I feel as if I spun in a circle ten times, then stopped. I called today, and spoke with a nurse who assured me that I would have had the side effects the first or second day. Well, I know my body and I don't feel right. So today will be my last day on this.

I took $T$ for about a month for acne and I started to get dry eyes after 1 month I went to the eye doctor and they said my tears weren't as good as they should be, I strongly believe that the drug caused my dry eyes. They get tired during the day. I have read that certain acne medications cause dry eyes. It's horrible I have the dry eyes every day. Don't take this drug at all.

I began taking $T$ to help with insomnia about two months ago.  The first time I took 25mg and it worked getting me to sleep, but left me groggy the next day. The next time I tried 12.5mg by cutting the 25mg section in half and that amount helps me get to sleep and leaves me feeling normal in the morning.  I was suffering from a bad bout of 2 months of insomnia.  $T$ saved me!

$T$ is definitely miracle cream, no doubt about it. I have been using it for about 14 years on my hands to treat eczema breakouts. However... I was not warned about using it for long term treatment and my doctor gives me refills when I ask for it. I am only now finding out about possible nasty steroid withdrawal symptoms if I stop using it.  After using it for such a long time I'm concerned but I plan to stop using it for awhile to see what happens.

Ive been to the ER for migraines too many times to count and have been given every kind of drug that can be given. I woke up this morning with a horrific migraine and vomiting and off I went. They gave me the $T$ and within less than a minute the pain was gone. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT! I've never had anything to work so well and so fast. I went home and slept for four hours afterwards. I'm so glad they decided to try this with me!

April 2016 out of the blue after having normal cycles and 5 pregnancies, I started hemorrhage and passing softball size clots. My doctor started me on 10 mg $T$ and that slowed down the bleeding.

I really enjoyed smoking but heart disease rings strongly throughout my family. I wanted to live to see grandchildren so I decided I needed to quit. My doctor prescribed $T$.

I actually slept wonderfully while taking it!

I have only been on $T$ for 3 weeks now, but wanted to insert my experience because it seems pretty different than some of the other reviewers. I had light spotting for about a week and a half four days into taking it, then it completely stopped. I didn't experience any other side effects until the next week: dizziness, lightheadedness, these effects would normally last 15 hours after taking the pill (I take it at 9PM). Feels kind of like I have morning sickness or something until 2PM, but I would like to add that is not consistently every day. I take my pill at the same time every day.

I use $T$ to control diarrhea which occurs sporatically following anal cancer treatment.This is a miracle drug for me.  Greatly improves my quality of life. I don't take it regularly, but it is reassuring to know I have it when needed. $T$ has never made me constipated, though I have noticed mild nausea recently.  This does not occur everytime I take it.

Using $T$ for 6 weeks with noticeable reduction in muscle soreness and overall general body stiffness. Suffered for years with stiffness, soreness, lack of flexibility, and difficulty getting down on a floor to work and very hard to get up. Weight doesn't help, but $T$ has relieved much of the apparent inflammation of muscles and joints. So far after 6 weeks I have no noticeable side effects.

$T$ has been a lifesaver. I've been battling crippling depression, suicide attempts and extreme mania. I have been through it all, tons of money and success to literally living out of a van. $T$ has completely equalized me and has allowed me to live a normal life. Bad akathesia as a side effect but if I take it at night I'm ok. Make sure to take this drug with food, that&'s vital!  Give it a try it may save your life.

I have had  diverticulitis attacks 2 times/year for several years and have been successful treating it with Keflex or Cipro. For whatever reason my gastro MD added $T$ in combo with Keflex this time. After 4 days I'm stoping it because of side effects. $T$ did not ease the diverticulitis pain faster and it has made me tired, lethargic to the point of not even getting dressed.

Have been on $T$ for probably around 2 years since I was 21. I chose the injection for convience and to help with my periods as they are heavy and extremely painful often making me vomit from excessive pain. Going back onto the injection was the worst decision I could have made. I have been back on it for at least 12 months and I bleed after 2months for about 2weeks and currently I have been bleeding for over 1 1/2 months. Never getting this shot again!!!

I have recently been put on $T$ for chronic migraines, in conjunction with a daily preventive medicine. I did not experience any euphoria, nor do I have any problems when I don't take it.  The problem is, I don't receive any pain relief from my migraines when I do take it.  I've tried so many different medicines and was hoping this might be the answer. I was wrong.

Took $T$ for lower back pain. Definitely made me drowsy, dry mouth and throat. It did not relax me. I found myself tightening the muscles all over my body to compensate for feeling so tired and weak to be able to move, stand and walk with the pain. Did nothing for the pain and was so drowsy I had difficulty focusing through it to function. I did lay down to try to relax and breath through and ended up passing out for over 4 hours. I guess it was good to get some rest but not having a choice about it...very uncomfortable with that idea.

I have difficulties using prescription eyedrops because most contain a preservative called benzalkonium chloride that I'm allergic too - my eyes get red, irritated and burn.

My period is very regular and has began to lighten up drastically from what it use to be. No weight, skin, or mood changes. To those who it doesn't work for, everyone reacts differently. For me it's been awesome and I plan on staying with it!

$T$ definitely was effective in taking away the symptoms of urgency after I had a urinary procedure done. It worked pretty fast within 30min. However the side effect if fluttering heart was very negative for me as I have an anxiety disorder so the heart palpitations triggered me to get very panicky. The side effect starting after an hour of taking it and subsided about 2-3 hrs afterwards. Overall I would recommend this medication because the effectiveness was excellent.

This is my first time taking such a high dosage of $T$, which was usual for me but I had abad tooth ache. I have taken $T$ before but at a lower dosage, however this new med has a higher dosage and the side effects are bothersome. I do not truly feel it is worth continuing to take. I'm consulting the doctor that prescribed the med to me from our local hospitals ER.

I have been on $T$ for a little over a month now and I have lost 7 pounds. Not gonna lie, I almost stopped taking it. The first 2 weeks I had severe stomach pains, each time lasting about 10 minutes, after the end of week 2, the pains stopped. I have no had the urge to drink coffee anymore, used to drink 3 cups a day. I am not eating as much, I used to eat a footlong sandwich from Subway, now I'm lucky if I finish half. This is not a medication for people looking for rapid results. I am taking it day by day and so far I am happy with my results.

My mom, being a doctor, set me up with $T$ and seriously it is the most incredible pill I have ever taken. Within 10 minutes, my stomach has settled and I'm ready to take on the day.

$T$ made my breasts huge (well a half size or so bigger). I'll take anything at this point. I'm less crazy hormonally.

$T$ has just plain awful tasting, and after all the pain and suffering, it did not clean me out well enough and so the doctor said I have to have the colonoscopy redone in six months!

I have been using $T$ for one week now.  It was working great in the beginning but after around the third day I got extremely tired around 12pm and all I wanted to do was take a nap.  I continue to take it thinking that this will change.  I only take 150mg, maybe I should ask the doctor to up the dose.

At the first sign of a cold sore, I have taken 2 g of $T$ and managed to prevent them from forming. As soon as I notice the tingle, I take it. Sometimes I get a little bit of a stomachache from it, but eating a moderate amount with it seems to prevent that. The mild stomachache is much more tolerable than cold sores though. Overall, I have been very happy with it!

I tried $T$ for 2 months, I lost 9 lbs. It was hard falling asleep at night, most nights I couldn't fall asleep until 4 or 5 am. It also made me feel depressed.

I was in a car accident with a head injury. I had intractable migraine and other headaches that came and went daily on top of that and three months after the accident my neurologist offered $T$. It's been 9 months and it took care of my headaches immediately. I didn't mind the side effects. I don't mind the side effects in comparison to the headache.

I just started taking $T$ 30mgs at bed time and it works great, but I also take 2mgs of Xanax in the morning and 2mgs at night so it really works well.

I've tried the others that dry your eyes and mouth, blurr your vision and even paralyze your muscles so that you can't urinate without concentrating on it. $T$ is the winner. It cuts incontinence and overactive bladder with no side effects. I love it.

I got my $T$ put in March 15th. The insertion was very uncomfortable but quick. I have only had very light spotting off and on since I had it placed. I have had a lot of cramping. I just hope that this birth control gets rid of my heavy periods and clots.

I've had $T$ since my 2 week exam after I  had my baby on May 24,2017. A week after insertion I started heavy bleeding. Two weeks later I'm still bleeding!!! I call my Dr. and nurse tells me I should have done research!! I'm so upset with myself. She told me I could bleed for up to SIX months STRAIGHT! I wish Dr. would have said this to me! I want it out. My husband  and I are ready to mess around too and we aren't the type to do anything if I'm bleeding so yea, its gonna be a problem if I'm like this for so long. I DO NOT recommend it.
Levonorgestrel

I have been taking $T$ for about 6 months, to prevent pregnancy. I've had regularly light periods and my appetite has drastically decreased, but I haven't been losing weight. It slowed my sex drive down in the first few months of use, but my drive is back to normal now. I am also very moody, lethargic, and constipated. However, I like it since it is preventing me from getting pregnant and it's free.
nuvaring

Took $T$ for the twelve weeks and was cleared of virus that I have had for almost 20 years. My viral load was in the 2 million range and no side effects at all. It has been 4 months now and still clear. My Doctor chose this treatment over others because I was treated in the early years with the interferon/ ribarvarin, and  it did not work for me.
Epclusa

Took $T$ for a sinus infection.  Six days in I couldn't rotate my forearms. 3 years later, numerous doctors, two surgeries and my arms are practically useless.  FDA black box warning on it people. Google the drug. Do not ever take, fluoroquinolones are poison. They were originally developed to give to soldiers exposed to Anthrax.  And try to never take generic.  US Supreme Court says if you do you are not allowed to sue the original drug manufacturer OR the generic company you used. This drug ruined my life.

I used $T$ for 2 yrs but with a gap of a few months in between. For the first month I was always nauseous or on the verge of throwing up within literally 30min-1hr of taking the pill but I decided to give it a go until the second month. After that first month I was fine. I did go through a few months of increased appetite but thank goodness I didn't gain weight some how. Periods are not as painful, long or heavy. My minor acne decreased. my hair is longer and stronger then its ever been. My chest did get bigger now that I think about it. Overall I like Apri especially since it only cost me $9.

If you haven't taken $T$ before, I'd recommend giving it a try. I've had pretty much no negative side effects other than a mild nausea after the first few pills in a new pack, and its helped a lot with my acne. My periods are also significantly shorter and less severe than they were with no medication/other birth control. Looking at other reviews, this definitely doesn't work well for some people, but its been really effective for me.
Estarylla

Given $T$ for H. Pylori. Within 48 hrs of ending the full course of medication I experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Large, round, flat hives formed on the soft of my arms and inner thighs. My hands began to swell, and then I felt my face begin to swell. The swelling moved from left to right across my face, and it eventually began to close my throat and enlarge my tongue. My husband drove me to an urgent care center where I received a shot of Kenalog and a Medrol dose pack.

I had $T$ given to me when I was hit by a car as I walked across the street.  I couldn't take meds I was given due to side effects.  My pain was so severe I was given a shot of $T$. What relief!  It worked extremely well for me.  Four years later I had sciatic nerve pain.  I asked my doctor for a shot of it.  After three days and nights of extreme pain and discomfort, the Toradol shot took it all away. I am so relieved.  No side effects- just good old pain relief!

I just got $T$ today 4/27/17 and the pain is unbearable. My fiance held me the second time after my doctor took it out because I was in tears the first time. I have a 0 pain tolerance. Took 1600mg (2 800mg morning and afternoon) of ibuprofen it does help but so does a heating pad. If anyone has advice for $T$ please let me know.

I was addicted to oxys in Anchorage for 3 years, buying them off the street.  I dropped out of college, lost several jobs, and hurt every person I cared for just to get high.  I moved away hoping to get away from the drugs, and just ended up at a methadone clinic for another 3 years.  I finally made the choice to start $T$, it's only been a week but I feel a hundred times better.

$T$ is a miracle! I still had some cravings, a little irritability, a few depressing nightmares- but I quit! I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for a decade. I have not had a cigarette in over a month, and live with people that smoke in the house. No patches, no gimmicks, just plugging through it with bupropion. I would recommend giving this a go to anyone.

I switched to this birth control $T$  (It made me depressed intensified my anxiety and I was having two periods a month). At first I was skeptical from initial water retention and moodiness but after the first month was over all those initial issues disappeared.

I just started using $T$ and I like it better than other diet pills I've tried such as Hydroxycut because it doesn't make me feel sick/ nauseous. BUT it definitely makes my heart rate skyrocket, so for the first couple days I would only take half a pill at a time.

$T$ is fantastic! No bloating or weight gain!! Yippee!!! Hot flashes are gone, helped the first week, would have a few here and their but they were mild and by the second month- they are totally gone and sleeping so much better- the feeling of anxiety is gone- life grand again! Immmmmm soooo happy!

I personally like $T$. I have only been on them for a month but I used to get horrible period pains where I had to stay home from school, couldn't eat or keep down anything, and had to lay in bed and now with these pills I am getting my period very light with little to no pain. It is a relief! I did get some migraines and sore chest but I got those when I wasn't on the pill as well. I would recommend birth control if you are having such bad cramps because it really helped me.

Well, I took $T$ for the first time on a Thursday, felt an erection like old days after seeing a hottie. I've been getting about 90% hard prior to Cialis. By Friday, I was going all night. And again Saturday and Sunday morning. It is awesome. My Dr said it might be mental anyway. And it might just be enough to get me back on track.

I have been on $T$ 75mg twice a day for 5 years.  The first year I took it 2 X each day.  After the methotrexate began to kick in, I now only take it when needed when I get a flare up.  At the most, only about once per week, sometimes less.  It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.

Personally, $T$ gives me a fixed drug eruption in the form of a huge, round rash on one of my breasts that is intensively itchy and burns. It feels like a horrible sunburn. Therefore, I am clearly not a fan.

I absolutely loved $T$ - great energy - great sex - felt good. I unfortunately suffered a side effect that I couldn't empty my bladder all the way. So that meant sleep deprivation. My MD thought it was a UTI, but getting off the medicine and seeing a urologist cleared up the symptoms. The urologist said it was a very common side effect of $T$. He put me on Flomax for a couple of weeks... Loved it, hate that I can't take it.

Took my first dose of $T$ 2 hours ago. I smelled it and thought to myself this won't be too bad.. It smells like cough syrup! Well, two sips in I was gagging like no other. It took about a half hour to choke it down. Instantly, cramps and the worst nausea I've ever experienced. Slowly a headache added to my problems and I've been miserable since. First movement just happened and yeah, faucet-butt that won't shut off!

$T$ worked right off the bat, after 30 minutes or so, could breathe much better, and as a smoker, helped my wheezing go away, and not as tired with more energy. NOW the BAD part. I have had a heart attack and have 3 stents. For 3 years, my bp has been perfect at 110/65 with a pulse of 58 to 65 even drinking caffiene and smoking. Since starting this, BP has increased a little, but pulse no matter what stays above 110 24/7. Otherwise works fine!

$T$ is the meanest diabolical cream. Not sure what sick experiment this is. Do not believe good review, probably someone from drug company. I had instant cramping, burnt the inside of me and the outside. Did not work!! Report to health Canada, the company itself or FDA. Needs to go!!!

I take $T$ often since I have anxiety a lot at school but now I have been very itchy and have had loss of appetite.. It doesn't work that well for anxiety and these side effects are horrible.

After 3 days of taking $T$ I was suffering from constant gastrointestinal issues, which is something I have never experienced on antibiotics before even with probiotics. On day 4 I began with severe itching, burning, and hives and returned to the doctor. This antibiotic also seemed to have little affect on my original illness. I am now on a Z pack and feel much better. Now I have to be on a long course of Prednisone for my allergic reaction which has yet to subside. This by far has been the worst antibiotic I have ever taken in my life. Never ever again!

I've been on $T$ birth control for six months and I love it. I had acne all over my back and very few on my face. Within the first month my face cleared up and some on my back.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG $T$! I like many of you really from what I have read had a great experience AT FIRST. I was on cloud nine towards the beginning trail of this prescription. I found that I would get dizzy or a tab nauseous but I found that staying hydrated and always having a water bottle with me helped out. I developed a problem where I would know what I wanted to say but when I went to speak it didn't come out right and literally made me sound like I was high or drunk. VERY SCARY!

A smoker for 30 years and decided to try $T$ after several failed atempts at quiting, three days into course I hated the taste of smoking. That was 14 months ago, take $T$ with food to stop the sicky feeling, don't give up give them a chance, they work.

Took the $T$ pill 1 hour after intercourse. I took it on an empty stomach, which you should NOT do. I felt crazy symptoms for about 1 month. It felt as if I were pregnant. I have been nauseous, tired, mood swings. Horrible feeling, and it lasted quite a while. 1 week after I had taken the pill, I got some spotting that lasted 3 days. But I just received my period today, which I am so happy about.

I started taking $T$ because of horrible PMS while on Mircette and did the three month continuous route. It kind of helped alleviate PMS but for some reason my body wouldn't listen to the pill and continued to have a monthly period well into the second three month span along with spotting. The breaking point was when I had a total PMS episode complete with migraine and heavy period about a month and a half into the second three months.

Taking the slow release of $T$, 120 mg version.  I take it at night about 30 minutes before bedtime.  Averts any dizziness since I am going to bed to sleep.  BP has been good 125/80 generally. resting pulse of about 60.  Thankfully I am optimal weight and I exercise 4 to 5 times weekly, mostly a 2 mile walk each time and about 50 situps. Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. mild constipation so I eat a cup of yogurt at least every other day.

I had to stop taking $T$ because I was having an operation. After a couple of days the operation was postponed and I forgot that I had stopped taking $T$. Anyway mid-day one afternoon I was having a horrible time because it seemed all movement had stopped, the next day the same. Then I remembered that I was not taking the $T$, well I went back to my daily dose and I am almost my old moving self. Thanks.

$T$ works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again.  Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.

Been on $T$ for around 9 months. 300mg at night. Found it far less sedating than Olanzapine. Its been a miracle for my Bipolar, absolutely no depression and no manic episodes. Yeah I put on weight but the effects on my mood and mental health have been incredible.

$T$ is effective in decreasing my depression, but I developed almost every side effect listed, (including anxiety, muscle soreness, unbearable joint pain, excessive sweating, severe memory loss, GERD, dysuria, brain shivers, hypothyroidism, loss of menstruation) and found myself on medications to treat each of them, ultimately using 19 prescription medications to deal with the side effects.  If I could have anticipated the side effects, and the expected difficulty of weaning off this, I would have continued to search for a better alternative.

I had the $T$ Implant put in October 2009 and have felt it has been the best choice for me. My period is irregular, I never know when I'm going to get it but so far that is the worst part I have experienced, my weight has stayed steady and have had no pregnancy scares, since my period has become irregular and sometimes spaced out by 5-6 weeks I will sometimes take a pregnancy test to make sure it is indeed working and so far so good, thumbs up from me.

I have been on this medicine $T$ for about a month. I was given samples of a higher mg than what I am prescribed and those seemed to work the best. Then, I couldn't afford to get the medicine from the pharmacy for about a week and had no bm during that time. Yesterday, I took the medicine and still nothing but stomach pain. Today, I am taking it again with the hopes of having some relief.

I couldn't tolerate zupra at all.  Moving to $T$ was wonderful. I've been on it for a year and a half and have had no side effects whatsoever. Blood glucose numbers and A1c (5.7!) have been good, but I also exercise and closely watch my diet.

I'm thinking a nice hose down of my insides might make me feel better... Wish me luck

I was prescribed 5mg of $T$ as a booster to the Wellbutrin 200mg I have been taking for over 5 years. The combination is great! I felt like myself in only a few days and it has continued to be effective over the past 18 months that I've been on the combination. I would highly recommend talking to your doctor about this, it has changed my life!

I've been on the $T$ for about 5 years and it has been awesome! I had no side effects, normal periods. Although my boyfriend could feel it sometimes but it wasn't painful for either of us so it wasn't a big deal.  I like it too because when my boyfriend was deployed for months at a time I could stay off it and put a ring in a few weeks before he was coming back. I would highly recommend it!
Nuvaring

I saw reviews on $T$ but decided to try it anyway, but I wish I hadnt. I was so anxious and had the worst mood swings. I would get so angry over little things I wouldn't give a second thought to normally. I snapped at my boyfriend, friends and family practically once in every conversation when I used to be so calm and light-hearted. I eventually thought enough is enough and switched to Junal Fe and finally back to my normal self. Orsythia also made me completely repulsed by food, so I lost about 12 pounds, but I'm barely 5 foot 2 so 12 pounds is a huge difference.

Do not use $T$ or any bisphosphonate. The first year I used it  3 of my fingernails had lifted off their nail bed. The 2nd year I got osteonecrosis of my left lower jaw. I loss 3 teeth, cannot have implants due to poor bone quality. The 3rd year my doctor had decided not to give it to me. I still suffered side effects of this drug. I was standing in one place ironing a shirt when I heard a pop in my leg and could feel my femur moving over.  That was 2 years ago and my femur is still fractured.  I just had my 4th surgery and hoping this heals my fracture.

I had pretty bad breakouts when I first started using $T$, but now that I use it my face is so much clearer! Any time I'm having a breakout, I put some Epiduo on it at night and its already better in the morning. The only bad thing with using this is it dries out your skin. So I have to use plenty of moisturizer! But it's great!

After years of suffering a Rheumatologist finally diagnosed fibromyalgia. He prescribed $T$  at bedtime. I had forgotten what it feels like to actually be rested in the morning! MUCH less pain the next day as well as not waking up to spasms during the night. The only problem I have with it is constipation, but I started Forteo injections for osteoporosis at the same time which can also be constipating, so I can't blame it entirely.

After using $T$ I felt the very 1st symptoms. . . Tingling mostly. I went to the pharmacy at 2am. Spoke to the pharmacist with a handful of treatment options from the shelf. The pharmacist explaining that the others were just for pain relief. Since I addressed the problem immediately consistently, I never broke out in what I dreaded. A cold sore. I am so thankful!!

I have taken $T$ for the past 30 years with very few side effects. It helps both my arrhythmia and my high blood pressure.

I take 80 mg of $T$ in the evening for Bipolar I with psychotic features.  It really helps to cut down the visual and auditory hallucinations though it sometimes makes me pretty tired in the morning. Sometimes I have a hard time driving first thing in the morning. It is worth it to straighten out my mind.

Had my gallbladder removed and they gave me morphine which didn't really help much but then I ended up with a bile leak due to complications and they put me on $T$ and every ounce of pain vanished seconds after it was put into my iv. It made me really sleepy but not nauseous at all. Very addictive but works amazing to relieve extreme pain.

I like $T$ for the most part. I have been on it for about a year and a half. I have gained about 5 lbs or so and I continue to have periods. They last for about 8 to 10 days but they are light and I get them every couple of months. I have noticed that my breasts are very tender and I haven't seen others talk about that. Anyone else have that problem?

I've been taking $T$ for a few months now. My blood pressure has gone from 140/91 ish to around normal. Amazing!
Lisinopril

Had sleep problems a long time, especially regulating sleep patterns. Took 5mg of $T$ for the first time last night. Within 30mins felt drowsy, went to bed and fell asleep immediately, woke up this morning feeling refreshed. Would certainly recommend and use again.

$T$ helped me get my A1c numbers down. If I would just follow the rules and eat right, it could do wonders. Also, for those getting the nodules at the injection site, put an ice pack on the site for about 15 minutes and you will probably not get a knot. Works wonders for me.

This medicine $T$ has given me a good few hours sleep for the past three nights. I had previously not been sleeping more than an hour or two for several weeks previous.

$T$ caused me worsening depression, facial acne and messed up my comprehension! I could barely come up with words to say. Be aware that depression is an adverse side effect and should be stopped immediately as it only gets worse. I am 21 years old and experienced induced mania because of SSRIs. I was prescribed $T$ 25mg after a psychotic attack. I took it for only 10 days because the depression got significantly worse day by day, especially when I upped the dose, to the point where I didn't even know who I was . Plus it made me numb and nothing was exciting.

$T$ really helped me recover from a horrid depression. This medication saved my life. It is a bit activating. At higher doses works as a great smoking cessation aid. LOVE IT.
Bupropion

I started $T$ 6 months ago. The first pack went like I had expected. I did have weight gain as well as acne which I never had before. The second pack was where everything went wrong. I bled the whole entire pack. Yep I'm getting off this medicine.

$T$ caused bone pain, faster pulse rate, hot flashes. Don't know if I can continue taking this for 5 years.
Anastrozole

$T$ was horrible!! I took the 2 for the first day and one onward for four days. It was so painful! My stomach hurt and I had some chest pains. It kept me up all night with pain. Please read side effects before taking.

I have had trouble sleeping for about 4 years after a breakdown I currently take an antidepressant and did have $T$ to help me sleep which worked really well and gave me a good nights restfull sleep.

$T$ actually makes me vomit violently. It feels like its burning a hole in my stomach. I've tried 3 different times. I have Hyperemesis and I take Zofran and Phenergan and when I try to add delcegis I vomit 10x back to back until its out.... Awful awful stuff.
Doxylamin

I took $T$ 2 x 25 mg for my gout pain, which was in my elbow and shoulders. It gave me great relief and I only take it when the pain arrives. It worked for me. Thank you.

I have been using $T$ on the front of my ear for a week. There is swelling itching crusting and so much oozing it will drip down my face. Around day 5 I started feeling tired and weak. Then day 6 and 7 I have felt like I have the flu..I feel awful. Lymph nodes seem swollen and throat is sore.  My lower back hurt as well one day but not everyday. I was worried the fluid dripped down into my ear canal. My doctor told me to stop using it!

For severe panic attacks, the only medication on the market for this is $T$, taken just before or at onset of attack.
lorazepam
1
This drug $T$ ruined 11  years of my life, continues to do so. I was given no addback therapy, nor told of any side effects, only the leaflet to read at home AFTER I'd already been given 3 month $T$ told it will help my excruciating Endometriosis pain. After reading leaflet in its entirety I immediately called my OB/GYN asked about addback, Calcium , lots more questions. I was scared of all side-effects listed on the leaflet and wished I had known about them before or that I could UNDO the shot! He told me worst that may happen are few hot flashes. My pain worsened, I got OSTEOPOROSIS, lost several teeth couldn't walk unasisted for 6mths. THIS IS TRULY A HORRIBLE DRUG!!!

$T$ really works plus the little bit of caffeine gets me going.  The only problem is I can no longer find it.  Any suggestions?

Azithromycin

Been on $T$ for just 3 weeks resulting in a weight loss of 22lbs. I don't feel hungry or binge eat anymore. I also walk at least 10,000 to 12,000 steps daily plus gym time 3 to 4 days a week so that also helped with my speedy weight loss. I started at 252lbs and now 230lbs. My goal is to reach a weight of 200lbs and cut my daily dose down to one pill a day. No side effects other than dry mouth and a bit of constipation. I highly recommend this medicine.

$T$ has been very effective on my bipolar depression. I have been on nearly every antidepressent available with limited or short-term success only. I have been taking Marplan for 3 months and have reduced my symptoms from continious to occasional. My side effects were severe hypotension, muscle pain, weight gain and inability to have orgasms. Everything has gone away except for the last two.
Marplan

I took one pill of $T$ last night,  only worked a little,  took one more today,  hope it works by morning without bad side affects.  I used to take 2 laxatives at once but experienced faintness,  nausea &amp; severe hot flashes. So I only will one and not repeat dose for at least 12 hours.

$T$ has been a God send for my condition, especially effective with the arthritis.  I stopped the infusions for about a year and since I've returned to the infusions, I've been getting lots of weird skin problems.

I started $T$ for chronic constipation.  I took one pill at noon yesterday, 12am today and just took another (11:45 am).   I guess I thought I would feel something by now.  No real cramps or noises in my bowel, it just seems like it's not doing anything yet. Its been almost 2 weeks since I had any movement at all.  Has anyone switched from this to Linzess or are they pretty similar medications?
Lubiprostone

For the last 2 months I am using $T$ and it is perfect. I am taking it in the morning and forgetting. It just works! Smooth and nice. I already forgot what diarrhea is! I feel like my life is changed

I have been on this birth control $T$ for over 2 years and I would have to say that it has its down falls and has its goods. I did get pregnant one time and that was from when I had missed some pills. I don't have any cramps like I used to before I started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.
Ortho Tri

$T$ helps with the constant horrid intrusive thoughts, I still  feel like I'm behind glass, although I'm easily destabilized, the sedation helps calm me, I've put on 6 stone in 4 years, restless legs and sometimes arms, however for me, I would take this medication because it's giving me enough stability to stay living!
Quetiapine
1
Had done this  process  3 timesbefore, 1st time use $T$. Co-pay is $125 since insurance won't cover this. Followed instruction exactly and no effect ion.  No BM after 1st dose, has three after 2nd dose. I have one hour left and still not clean. Sucks.

The side effects of $T$ are terrible. The dizziness, headache, and not being able to understand what was going on, felt like I was in a cloud.
Simvastatin
-1
I had to stop taking $T$ after it made my throat swell up and affected my breathing.  I strongly believe that it was the yellow colouring in the medication which caused this rather than the drug itself as I have had allergic reactions to Tartrazine on several occasions and I now read labels thoroughly.  I wish medications could be prescribed that do not have added colourings as a large number of people, like me, are allergic to several azo dyes.
Amoxicillin

I was on $T$ now I have acne which I haven't had for 10yrs. And missing periods and bad PMS and depression. And my sex drive has dropped.
Loestrin

My pharmacy prescribed me $T$ because they didn't have the other in stock. It has been awful. My period lasts 3-4 days with no cramping usually. But on Aviane it has lasted 7 days and its super heavy with cramps. I've been irritable and yelling even about the smallest things. I cry over every little thing that happens to me.

The best part of taking $T$ is that I can still have an orgasm! All the other birth control I've ever tried I've hated, because of that and stronger side affects. This  pill has worked great for me.

$T$ worked very well for my severe panic attacks. My concern was the severe dependency issues that come with prolonged usage. I took it once a day in the evening for about three weeks, I felt  like I was losing my sanity. Combination of Klonopin in the beginning and Prozac to level me out  worked very well for me.
Klonopin
1
After receiving $T$, nothing has changed at all! I still have fevers, coughing fits, and a horrible headache. It hurts to lift my head off of the pillows and even walk around since my joints hurt from the fevers. Matter of fact, my fevers have been increasing rather than decreasing! Other medications I have taken worked as soon as I ingested it. I would not recommend to anyone.
Cefdinir

Switched from Lantus to $T$. Same results. Not at goal. Tastings are more or less in the low 100s each and every day. Not fearing hypos like before and feel much better

I have been on pain medicines since 1993 for back pain. I have been taking $T$ 40 Mg 3x per day, last month my pain management Doctor said that he was no longer writing for $T$ because of it showing up on the streets of our community. He said I had the choices of Morphine, Methadone, or Opana ER. I chose Opana so now I am on 30mg twice a day. The only benefit that I am experiencing is that it takes away the withdrawal symptoms and they don't drop you like when an $T$ wears off but for me the pain is still there.
Oxycontin

$T$ worked perfectly for clearing up my rosacea. 
Oracea

My child has been on $T$ for a while now and we have not noticed any changes really. He still has aggression, self injurious behavior, and extreme levels of impulsivity. I can't take him out in public because he randomly hits people especially small children. If he is prevented from harming others he starts hurts himself until we have to restrain him. The doctor has already increased his $T$ up to 10mg twice a day. I am terrified to take him off because it might make him worse. I'm so lost.
Abilify

I am on a maintenance dose of 1 mg 3 times a day along with a different xanax .5 if I am having a panic attack. I'm agoraphobic and suffer from anxiety because of multiple reasons. I find $T$ is a amazing medication that helps tremendously. I wouldn&#039;t have the life I have today.

$T$ worked good with slight side effects frequent twitching of the left eye, and very bright yellow colored urine, dry mouth. Side effects were not severe enough to discontinue and the infection was effectively treated.
Macrobid

I switched from shot to the $T$ Bc the shot increased my appetite and I felt like I was going crazy with my emotions on the shot. Since switching to this pill, my appetite is back to normal and my crazed emotions are no longer existent. Would recommend
Orsythia pill

This is one of the worst experience in my entire life. After taking $T$ , I had diarrhea for a week, yeast infection, dry red rashes at the palm of my hands and inner thighs, hemorrhoids, exhaustion, blurry vision, increased heart rate which caused me not able to sleep. I WILL NEVER take it again, worst meds in the world.

I started using $T$ two years ago. I can still remember the first night I tried the medication.  I woke up the next morning feeling like 25 lbs was lifted off me.  I suffered since age 27 and now I am 40 and feel great!  Remember to have your blood checked regularly to be sure all is normal.

A suggestion for people that have insomnia problems with $T$--take it in the morning. The first week I was on this I took it at night and there was no sleeping to be had. I've been on it for 8 months now and ever since I switched to mornings and I've been sleeping just fine!

Loved this birth control $T$. I began taking this my freshman year of college (did gain the freshman 15- well, 17) but I assumed the weight gain was due to stress and eating Taco Bell and drinking. The first few months I had some problems but eventually got on some anxiety medicine and been fine ever since! I loved having my period only every 3 months. No acne. Great birth control! Would recommend to anyone!

$T$ worked well, but had to stop due to conscription, blurred vision, and energy.

I take $T$ much in the way people take Rolaids.   As soon as I feel like my intestines are reacting poorly I will take 2 $T$ 500mg and my stomach calms down within 10 minutes.  I have no idea why it works for me,  a Crohns patient for 10 years in this way.  I do not ever take it as a preventative medicine.  As a topical way to calm intestine discomfort, it just seems to be miraculous.

$T$ alone can cause nausea. I highly recommend everyone listen to your body. Nausea is the bodys natural reaction to try to rid itself of something bad (viruses, foods, drugs) whatever it may be. This drug is NOT the answer.  Sure you will lose weight, but at what expense....nausea, ringing in the ears, vertigo and dependence on the drug which is very expensive?
Bupropion

I have been taking $T$ since 2012 started on provigil built a tolerance against it in 2 months. I take 250 mg a day but I split the pill and take each half at specific times usually  between 6-9 am the other at 3pm to 6pm (depends when I took the first one) seems to help me stay awake a little more that way. It lasts for about 1-2 hours on me with each half.

I would not recommend $T$ to ANYONE. I have had bleeding in my urine for over two weeks and the doctors associated it with a UTI. After being given $T$, and symptoms persisting they gave me septa. I took it for two days twice a day with food was fine, on the third day not so much. I began shaking uncontrollably, dry mouth, I was incoherent to the point I couldn't even understand what people were saying to me, heart was racing, I was dizzy, and extremely nauseous. It literally felt like I had been roofied (drugged up) . I don't even remember half the night and I had horrible insomnia. I don't even understand how this is on the market. Would never EVER take this again!

Worst birth control ever. Since being on $T$, I have gained 10 lbs, fainted twice, have horrible headaches and dizzy spells, nauseous constantly, no appetite, very sad, and get angry very easily. I also have barely any sex drive whatsoever. I barely have energy to want to do anything. I could sleep all day if I let myself. I've never felt so horrible in my entire life. After getting sick of gaining weight and fainting, I am finally stopping the pill. It is not worth it. BC is literal poison to the body. This brand just happens to be the worst one.

I have been using $T$ for just about 3 months now and I am definitely not too fond of it. It makes me extremely moody. I get mad easily and at times I feel like I just want to cry for just about anything. Because of this, it messed up my relationship quite a bit and I have absolutely no desire to keep taking it.

My 3-yr old had severe, rare behavioral side effects to all the other asthma controller meds; they changed him from a shy, sweet boy into an angry and aggressive one. With $T$ he is a LOT more himself and only slightly angrier and energetic. I recommend trying this medicine to see if it works better for you, too. It has kept our child out of the hospital and we are thankful for that.

I have been on $T$ for over a year now and it's safe to say $T$ saved my life. I was having really bad anxiety for 3 to 4 month and that brought on the depression it got that bad I was running into the wall to try stop the feeling. After the doctors seen me they put me on it on 15mg for 6 week. I dramatically seen a difference in the anxiety but still was feeling really down so the doctors put in up to 30mg and have been on since. I can go to my job with no problems.

$T$ is an awesome stuff. I'm a nursing assistant in a nursing home and ended up getting a migraine in the middle of my shift. Nothing usually helps my migraines, let alone gets ride of them completely. But my migraine was 100% gone within ten minutes of taking $T$. It was amazing! Never gonna need anything else for my migraines.
Excedrin

Was put on 10mg $T$ for general anxiety. I was on $T$ for 5 days and just had to stop. Horrible anxiety, feelings of depression I have never had before, absolutely no appetite, migraine, bad dreams, falling asleep at work while getting more than enough sleep at night, forgetful in my everyday tasks, overall hazy and strange feeling.  Will go back to Ativan and will never take an SSRI for my anxiety again-not worth it.

I've been taking $T$ for a few weeks now. I've gained alot of weight.. so much in fact we thought I was pregnant! AND I'M NOT! I've been feeling nauseous, and having cramps.

I was vomiting for over a day. I was ready to go to the hospital for an IV because I was so dehydrated.

No more vomiting after the dose... a God send!

I was so anxious all the time I left school and it was just so bad I didn't hang out with friends for months but after being on it I can't even begin to explain how great I feel. I never feel nervous or anxious for ANYTHING I'm back at school , going to football games , hanging with friends everyday , and making new ones . This is the BEST. I have felt in so so long , probably ever! I'm so thankful for this medication ! It takes about 3 months for it to actually work but I HIGHLY suggest it!!!!!

I'm 25 single mother to 8 year old twins an IUD was my choice of birth control I've had $T$ over 5 years already and I can say it's perfect haven't gotten pregnant, period lasts about 3 days, no mood swings, no pain, no heavy period. I love it and I'm happy I chose $T$ I had used other birth control methods and hated them. If you're not planning to have kids soon this is the best method to avoid having any lol

Was on this pill $T$ for two years. Gained about 15 pounds, had cystic acne around my periods, and my mood swings were unbelievable. I would find myself getting so angry and irritated at everyone and everything for absolutely no reason. Perks were I didn't get pregnant and my periods were short and light, with no cramping. Although works great!

I have been operated on for Bladder cancer. My Doctor tried many pain medications to alleviate the pain from Bladder spasms as a result of the removal of the cancer from my bladder. $T$ is the only medicine that gave me relief from the spasms. Thank goodness it was available. I use it only as needed for the spasms, and it is not long term, however it has taken care of the problem and let me recover without the pain.

Tried $T$ for over 4 weeks. I didn't feel any different and seemed to get sicker the longer I was on it. Never got the rash but had pain all over my body (bones, arms, legs, stomach, etc). It was so bad I couldn't get out of bed without crying and being in severe pain. Wound up in the hospital and after being off of it for just over 2 days I was back to normal!

Unbelievable!  After suffering everyday with sciatica nerve pain, losing sleep, falling into depression, I tried one pill, $T$. Nothing else I tried worked.  $T$ did exactly what my body needed to get relief from pain and inflammation. I will continue to take it for a week to be sure that all traces of sciatica and inflammation are completely gone.

$T$ is a miracle medicine. It has gotten terrible publicity lately. I took it in 2004 with terrible and painful acne and have had clear skin ever since. Nothing else worked and I tried everything. The side effects are completely trumped by the effectiveness of the medicine.

Very positive experience, $T$ is the only one I can take with no side effects.. All others I had to stop early on because of unbearable side effects. $T$ makes me feel better but only at a lower dose. If I take 20mg or over I feel lethargic.  Give it a try!

My doctor started me on 200mg of $T$ a day. The first few days were fine and then after about a week the crazy suicidal thoughts started. Then came the mood swings and short fuze. After 2 weeks of this medication I couldnt stand anyone around me or even myself. I didnt want to be talked to or even looked at I felt depressed, life wasn't worth anything. So, my doctor changed me to Prozac 20mg and so far seems to be a good fit.

$T$ cleared up my UTI in only 4 days. I was afraid to use it based on the comments on this site but keep in mind, most people who take time out to comment are those with negative experiences. Usually people with great experiences like myself don't take time out to talk about how well a medication works-they use it and go on with their daily lives. It's been over a year now and no reoccurrence of UTI. I had zero side effects.

Dr prescribed with $T$ for acne. I been using it for 3 years now and my face has stayed clear. Whenever I experience a breakout I just dab it on as needed after I wash my face.

Taking $T$ was the worst decision of my life. I have really bad anxiety and my doctor perscribed one 37.5 mg a day. I took it for the first time and got extremely nauseas.

I got $T$ insterted April 2015 and it is now October. I haven't had any crazy side effects at all. My first period was a bit heavy but not bad. My next few were very light. But I suddenly stopped getting a period until now in October and it's quite normal- not heavy or light. I have always been sensitive but I feel like it might actually be giving me mood swings. Besides that everything is perfectly normal and I don't see any reason why anyone would not recommend it.

I love this birth control $T$ and it definitely works. The only thing I wonder about are periods. Overall I do recommend it.

$T$ is a miracle drug...I would be dead without it! Because of $T$, I got my life back.  I got a great career now, I wake up every morning looking forward to life and now I actually have money, a good amount of it....and it feels great!

I chose $T$ because I had rough side effects from hormonal birth control. I was also not sure if I wanted more children, probably not due to my age and health problems I had with my last pregnancy, but just in case I changed my mind I didn't want to choose something permanent. Imagine my surprise when I became pregnant. An ultrasound showed it was correctly positioned. I was relying on $T$ to be as effective as advertised. Don't use it!

Am using $T$ for post-surgery of my Cervical area. It  does a good job on my  headaches and throat pain.. It is a  lot better than Tylenol and safer than Hydrocodone.

I have been taking $T$ as needed for chronic back pain caused by a congenital disorder for almost 4 months now, and it is a life saver.  Pain control is much better than anything over the counter, Tylenol with codeine, and Vicodin, with none of the awful side effects I get with those pain medicines.  I have been taking it on and off as needed, and I have not developed any dependence. Great medicine for me.

I have been taking $T$ for less than a week and it has already given me favourable results. I would recommend this to anyone!

$T$ is awesome. Take it and wait 15 minutes. Sleep and thats all. Its great!
Ambien

After a few other medications failed to help, I tried $T$ for 13 weeks. It immediately made me nauseous, and the effect was constant--not just when I took the dose. I also had no improvement in my PTSD symptoms. Eventually I gave up and had to try another drug.

I started taking $T$ about four years ago, stopped maybe two or three years ago. Great success, my acne vanished and I have only had acne one time since, when I accidentally used moisturizer on my face. Only side effect I had was dry skin (mostly just chapped lips), which is to be expected, but it is pretty much back to normal now.
Isotretinoin

$T$ has given me energy, stopped my crying, and for the first time in my life I can say out loud that I don't hate myself. Although I am extremely sensitive to medications and usually suffer all the worst side effects, I have had no negative effects from this medication other than gaining about 5 pounds over a two month period.
Pristiq

I was on $T$ for probably little over a year, and my side effects started progressively getting worse. I went from being nice to instant bad for no reason. My migraines got worse (almost every day) and sex drive went way down. I just got off this pill.

$T$ has worked great for preventing pregnancy, but has increased my migraines greatly and also has lowered my sex drive. I have also noticed since taking it I have been less happy and occasionally a lot more moody.

$T$ seemed to help somewhat at first (for a few months) but then the suicidal thoughts returned. I'm now being taken off. It just isn't working any more and I'm still in deep depression. So thankful that my doctor is switching me to something else.

Herniated disc in lower back, Could barely stand. I went to my Dr, he prescribed $T$, and I felt amazing after the first dose. I felt great the first day, I'm on day two now, feel a little tired...but sleep is great with no pain. Hope it lasts.

Flexeril

Just starting day 3 of $T$ for double middle ear infections.  Almost immediately the drainage down my throat was better and today I can actually talk without coughing each time I open my mouth so it appears to be getting rid of all the fluid.  Slight amount of diarrhea, but not too bad.  So far it appears to be working.  Hoping that at least some of my hearing will start to return.

$T$ worked well as a birth control. I had no spotting or bleeding during the 3 months I took it. However, it made me very emotional and moody.

$T$ has made a hugh improvement in my ability to function. Early meds like methotrexate and steroids only had bad side effects. In the year I have used $T$ and I can use my hands much better. My psoriasis is gone. I still know when the weather is changing. I no longer suffer like I did.

I suffer from anxiety,depression and PTSD. $T$ has proven to be a great alternative over a benzo.  Being non habit forming is the best par. I do get headaches and fatigue but it is better then the side effects associated with benzo. I recommend this to anyone looking for a non addictive alternative to zanex!

I was on the $T$ 100 mg every 2 days. I think they work just as good if not better. It didn't give me the anxiety or weird feelings I get off certain pain pills.

Took $T$ for 2 weeks and gained 2-3 pounds. I had been told to stay on it for a few months to detetmine its effectiveness. I discontinued it because of severe bladder spasms.

Have been using $T$ for more than 12 months. The first few weeks my face was slightly red and irritated so I added oil free moisturizer before applying. I also experienced an initial breakout but after a little over 2 months my face started to clear up. Now I'm 100% clear and it's  helping me get rid of scars and red marks. Patience is really the key with this treatment.
Tretinoin

Been using $T$ for 10 years and has always kept my Rosacea at bay.  It stings during the first week of use but definitely worth enduring that discomfort, the results are amazing! A tube now last me almost a year as it only takes a tiny bit of cream to maintain clear skin.

$T$ has worked wonders for my daughter! Really effective!
Olopatadine

I just used $T$ about 45 minutes ago. So far so good! I have a little bit of discomfort but that was there before I used the product. I had a lot of white discharge before use!(due to yeast infection) I recommend this product.

$T$ worked the best for me with sinusitis, where as the "z-pack" did not relieve me at all.
Vantin

I got diagnosed with ADHD and $T$ is my first medicine. It helps me focus but the side effects make me miserable. I'm starving right now but I don't want to eat and my throat is dry. I can't sleep and this side effect makes it worse because I have asthma and severe allergies so I can't sleep and I have twitches bad. I twitch my left shoulder blade a lot now and sometimes it wont stop.

I have chronic rib pain from nerve damage, without $T$ I would not be able to work.  It has literally saved my life!

$T$ is just torture!  I was coughing a little  and had some allergy congestion the pharmacist recommend this stuff.  Its 2:00 AM I took two pills at 3 in the afternoon and I have been coughing my lungs out ever since. I'm literally coughing so hard I'm sweating and have a headache I feel edgy and there is no hope of getting sleep tonight.

I was on $T$ for 8 months and all of a sudden my tongue started feeling funny. I stopped taking it for a day and it seemed to get better. The next day after taking it my tongue swelled up. Seems I had a bad allergic reaction to the medication. So be warned if your tongue starts feeling funny!

$T$ is just a wonderful medicine! So glad my gastrointestinal doctor suggested it, so sorry it took 19 months after gall bladder surgery to ask him for something. Medicine worked the very first morning and has continued to work. What a relief!

$T$ worked from day one for me. I had used a low dose for about 5 years and then stopped using it. I was clear for awhile but need to get back on it to have the quality of life I had while using it, I felt a little weird the first week I used it, but that feeling eventually went away.
Minocycline

Having both Post traumatic stress disorder and chronic severe back pain due to 2 unsuccessful back surgeries, I was the perfect candidate for anesthesia using $T$ for my last 3 surgeries. For both the PTSD and chronic back pain, symptomolgy has been reduced  by at least 75%. I could not be happier! Finally and again!

ZERO STARS. I became pregnant in October 2016 with the IUD $T$ in place. I felt sick in mid November and thought I had flu. I hadn't had a cycle but didn't worry because the strings were in place. After experiencing nausea and cramping, I took two pregnancy tests which came back positive. I went to the doctor and I was six weeks pregnant. I had the IUD removed!

Now onto Week 5 of non smoking with $T$. Have tried many cessation tools (patches etc) but $T$ has been the best for controlling urges to smoke easier. However, side effects include insomnia, tiredness, lucid dreams, lethargy making me sick. Otherwise works!

$T$ did not work for me. The sedating effects were almost more than I could handle, and I constantly had the feeling of being underwater as I tried to talk and communicate with those around me. It worked on my symptoms a little bit, but not enough to make up for the weirdness I felt from the side effects.

$T$ seemed fine for the first couple weeks, until I got a fever of 103 degrees. My doctor instructed me to stop taking it if my temperature reached 103 degrees, so I stopped for a week or so. My temperature returned to normal, so my doctor instructed me to start $T$ again and it caused me the worst imaginable pain in my whole torso. It turns out the it gave me Pancriatitis. I had to spend 3 days on an IV drip in the hospital and an all liquid diet for a week after. Worst product ever!
Imuran

Diagnosed with Fibromyalgia several months ago, probably have had the symptoms for more than a year. $T$ has been an answer to prayer. I am pretty much pain free, unless I exert myself or sometimes just have a bad day.  But, the good days far outweigh the bad.  Still nap occasionally, still have insomnia occasionally, but am totally happy with the way I feel.

I took this medicine $T$ for several months and it caused me cough, it also affected my sinuses. Then I started developing headaches. I thought it was viral in nature but this continued on for 2 months. Then my hair started to fall out and I stopped taking this medicine.  Took several days for it to leave my system and I feel much better without it.

Had back surgery in May 2009, and due to scar tissue have chronic pain. Working now with a pain management specialist and taking $T$ and it does help alleviate the pain, but only take when I have to. Only side effect for me is a little sleepiness.

$T$ is a very good medicine that works for my knee pain, sometimes I do have to top it up with Tylenol Arthritis. All in all I recommend it for osteoarthritis.

I was put on $T$ and my headaches or vision problems did not improve, in fact they got worse.  I have had more migraines since starting this than I ever did before. The side effects are awful! no appetite, foggy head (I am barely able to function day to day), nausea, everything you try to eat tastes AWFUL. I can not continue taking it!

I can't say enough good things about $T$. My doctor says it's the only medication in the class of drugs that last the whole 24 hours. It especially helps with my urgent feelings.

After implanting $T$ I didn't bleed at all for the first two weeks. But after that I've been bleeding everyday mostly heavy with clots since. I feel so tired all the time maybe due to the bleeding but also I have been gaining weight and I'm not much of an eater anyways. I know my doctor said bleeding can last up to 6 months but this is horrible and I will remove this once I get another form of BC.

Cannot get it to stay on. Don't know why anyone would recommend it. Went thru 3 patches of $T$ in 3 days because they do not stick, wouldn't even stay on with waterproof tape over it. Insurance won't pay for another box of 4 which should last a month.

Around 1 hours later of unprotected sex I took the $T$ pill and I am happy to say that I got my period today 3 days sooner! (This was also around the time the calendar said I was ovulating) so don't freak out! As long as you take it as soon as possible you will be fine!

I struggled to get the right dosage of $T$, took about 2 months to get it right. But now, almost a year later, I am a different person.  I have started having fun again, almost nothing sets me into panic mode, and have become a healthy weight again since I regained my appetite.

After using $T$ the first 3 months I had a period every 14 days. They lasted about 5 days, slightly heavier bleeding than normal for me. Then after the 3rd month, my periods went back to their normal 28 day off, 6 day periods. I'm breastfeeding my 7 month old, so this is a great option.  No weight gain, no mood swings, no soreness or anything negative.

I had a hysterectomy 10 years ago and having dryness problem so Dr prescribed $T$ and after using it for about 6 weeks I started cramping  like I was beginning to start my period again and my breasts were hurting so bad just like the old days!  Called my doctor was taken off of it immediately due to previous breast cancer and she said the estrogen from it gets in the bloodstream.

Miracle! I had obsessive thoughts that I recognized and could not get rid off.  Tried years of therapy and one year of Lexapro with no results.  The thoughts had cost me relationships in the past and was starting to ruin my latest and best one also. I finally tried $T$ and even at the low dosage of 25mg, I started to see results after two weeks of taking it. The side effects are a drag but they start going away.
Clomipramine

The side effects of $T$ can be damaging.  After a year of being on $T$ I became a compulsive gambler ( one of the side effects).  I became suicidal at one point. Spent some time in a hospital, where we discovered the root of my problem was this med! Don't use it!

$T$ was absolutely horrible. It made me not be able to breathe and I had to be rushed to the ER. All the doctors told me they didn't think it was the pill but I went off of it and all the breathing troubles stopped. I do not recommend this pill because it made my sister sick as well.

I take $T$ and I sleep like a baby all night! I normally fall asleep relatively quickly and wake up around 2 or 3am with terrible back pain and am practically up the rest of the night. Ever since this combo I have finally found rest! The 2 on their own did nothing for me just fyi!

I have had various SSRIs and etc - nothing worked. Just gone on 2.5mg $T$ and feel it has saved my life. Seems I had crippling anxiety without being aware of it, as no panic attacks etc. So there are some people with bad experiences,  but do not generalise.

After trying dozens of other meds with no results, my doctor prescribed me $T$,  I was started on 5mg a day and worked my way up to 20mg a day.  Even at the lowest dose of 5mg, I started  to notice my depression lifting and my anxiety reducing.  I became more social on it as well.  The higher the dose the better I got.  It took about a month to feel a major change.
Brintellix

$T$ is the first anxiety medicine I have ever been on, and it is by far the worst experience ever. My moods are anxious, depressed, and irritable. At first, I thought I was just overwhelmed with school and work, after reading some other reviews, I realized it's the $T$ doing it to me. If I take one due to an anxiety attack, about an hour later I am crying and talking about how much I hate myself, then about 30 minutes after that stops, I get extremely irritable and everything makes me mad. I've quit taking it until my follow up appointment and I can get it changed. I will never try this again!
Buspar

I like $T$, my only problem is I do seem tired more and not in the mood to have sex at all which is bad as I&#039;m in a relationship. I also noticed I pee way to much now and wake up in the middle of the night to go pee 1-3 times since taking the pill. But my periods have been better and shorter , no cramps, and no pregnancy!

I started using $T$ and it has being 2 months. THANK YOU FOR THIS BIRTH CONTROL! I am 23 and its my first time using birth control. I was really scared to get on any kind of birth control but after two babies, it was time to think of it and to take it seriously! I went to my OBGYN and she recommended this pill and it is going pretty well.

$T$ is GARBAGE and should be taken off the Market. I was hospitalized with pneumonia. The doctor prescribed it for me when I was released from the hospital. It has destroyed my appetite as well as my stomach. I can't sleep. I am nauseous every day. I have 2 more doses to take. I decided not to take them. I can't tolerate all the side effects.

I had a severe allergic reaction within 1 1/2 hours of taking my first dose of $T$. Pounding heartbeat, redness and fainted for the first time in 57 years of life.

$T$ works on a panic attack like you wouldn't believe and has saved me from all the ER visits throughout my life and I also suffer from deppresion. $T$ did straighten my life out. It is a miracle pill and I recommend it if you have anxiety or panic disorder. It's really great!

$T$ has cleared up my skin completely. Contrary to the first comment someone posted, this is the first antibiotic that has worked without giving me constant yeast infections.  The only drawback is the sensitivity to sunlight. One day at the beach with SPF 30 still caused me to become ill and badly burned.
Solodyn

This drug $T$ literally  Knocks.  You.  Out.  And it also gives you tremors, so don't plan to do precision anything if you're on it.  It dehydrates you and makes you have to pee a lot.

$T$ is the worst birth control ever, make me sick, I have headaches since the day 1, mood swings, anxious , was feeling terrible, so I found out that a lot of people taking this birth control are having the same conditions, so I stoped, the next day my headache was gone.

I had my first $T$ last week and within 3 days, I can honestly say I have no pain for the first time in weeks.  I didn't have any reactions or side effects except for feeling exhausted, but that maybe related to not being able to sleep for weeks prior, due to pain.  I am so happy with the effectiveness and results I have had.  I would definitely recommend it!
Remicade

This is the first review I've ever wrote in life. I say that to say, this is how horrible $T$ is, so bad that I had to write a review about it. I started the $T$ patch 3 weeks ago. First week of using the patch I notice a difference in my body. I was very nauseous, migraines was almost everyday, and loss of appetite. Second week, I was very very emotional, I would cry for no reason along with being very moody. I'm literally nauseous everyday now, I have vomit a few times. Long story short, I have pregnant symptoms. STAY AWAY FROM THE PATCH!! It's horrible!

Don't do it! after taking $T$ for about two weeks I found myself becoming suicidal.  As a veteran with PTSD I highly recommend anybody that's on antidepressants or antipsychotics to stay away from this prescription.

After using $T$ I can say- Do not take this bad medication. This is good sleeping pill. Yes it's calm down at night if it takes on night but after waking up it's giving hang over like you drunk 15 shots of vodka the night before

I started taking $T$ about 12 hours ago.  My muscles are very weak, I'm dizzy, restless, didn't sleep last night, and having a very hard time focusing.  I'm sure this is a great drug if you need to go to these extremes, but it's a little much for me.  I'm calling the Doctor to get off of it this morning.

I posted on here a couple of days ago to say I was starting $T$ and well, 3rd day in and I had the worst panic attack of my life, passed out, vomited, was dripping with sweat. The first 2 days were so easy but have decided not to keep taking it. Will head back to my doctor. Don't think this drug is for me.

$T$ made me feel awful. I woke up everyday with a bad headache, experienced nausea, dizziness, and extreme tiredness throughout the week (everyday). I don't think I can finish the full week as I need to resume my life. I wouldn't take this again.

Took it for basilar type migraines triggered by fibromyalgia due to a car accident when I was 12. $T$ works too well in me. All the surrounding muscle of each trigger point injected locked up. This works great in my mother who has a different type of migraine.

I used the $T$ for a severe tooth abscess/infection that was painful and extremely inflamed. After only 36 hours of treatment, the infection began to subside and the pain level dropped drastically. This medicine performed very well and I would suggest it to someone else.

I have been on $T$ since 2005 (8 years). I started taking this medicine when I hit rock bottom. I was addicted to percocet, morphine and klonopan. I hated myself. My doctor suggested I take $T$. 8 years later, I am still on this medication. I have never relapsed while on it!!!!! I have a few side effects: dizzy, sweaty and tired. These effects are nothing compared to the way I was living my life addicted to opiates. I am truly thankful for $T$!

Soon after beginning $T$ I began to feel really wonky, couldn't sleep no matter how I tried. As much as I wanted to quit, I gave it 6 weeks anyway. Like many medications, thought the side effects would pass. They didn't. Just not worth it!

I started using $T$ and I lost 16 pounds my first 30 days. Gives you energy, and makes less hungry. Eager to see what happens my next 30 days. It gives you plenty of energy to exercise. Love it.

$T$ is awesome.  Not only does it take the hunger away, it boosts energy.  I've been on $T$ and went from 196 to 135 lbs in 4 months, with only 30 minutes of exercise 5 days a week, plus the significantly reduced diet that this pill allows. It made losing weight easy.

I have suffered from severe depression and social anxiety for years. After 3 days on $T$ my world felt completely different. Everything feels right again and for the first time in ages I feel happy. The only side effect I have encountered is random bouts of fatigue but I have been told it will balance out after a few weeks. This medicine is incredible and I can't believe it took me so long to admit I needed it.

$T$ are a God send for Clusterers.  The ONLY drawback that I experienced was the expense which forbids me from using them on a regular basis...but the tablets are a good substitute... just takes much longer to work.  The injections work almost instantly!

$T$ is a God send to me! I am currently detoxing from a 6 year (legal) opiate use. Over 50 and detoxing is no way to live. The insomnia was the absolute worst thing I was experiencing; 2-2 1/2 hours and watch the clock spin. Take $T$ right before bed and 8-9 hours, with no hangover. What a blessing.

I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis about 2 years ago after experiencing severe stiffness in the neck and shoulders. I could barely turn my neck at all. Within a couple of weeks of taking $T$ I was fully flexible and back to my rightful age of 27. 2 years on and I even sometimes forget I have this illness. I recently stopped taking it for 2 weeks and I soon found out what wonders it was working! It is incredible.

I have been taking $T$ for 3 years now.  I am healthy, exercise, and not overweight.  The reason for adding it to my daily vitamins is that my partner likes a daily intimate time.  With intimate time 5 to 6 days a week I fine that both of us have a very special time.  She knows I take it and has no problem with what I call my daily vitamin.  I see my cardiologist and have blood work yearly.  So far all lights are green and thumbs up.

I have been taking $T$ for 6 months. I started after a very sad time in our family and some months after this I had days where I would just breakdown and cry for no reason.  I found out that depression is in our family and has made me more aware of this disease. I fell generally better.  Overall I fell $T$ has been helpful and would reccomend it to others.

I am in week 2 of $T$, I noticed that I'm getting a lot of pimples around my forehead area. I don't understand why because my forehead didn't have any pimples before I started using $T$. Hopefully it will improve because I'm really insecure. I feel like when I talk to others that's all they look at! Anyways, epiduo burns really bad and I have dry patches of skin. Whenever I touch it, it starts burning.

Bipolar 2(now 65) with years of trying every mood disorder medicine around until $T$ was recommended for Bipolar 2. Felt back in my own skin again after 20 years of enduring life. On 200mg twice daily takes a while to adjust dose so please be patient..it gave me back my life!

For me $T$ has been the worse medicine in the world.  I took it four days and thought I would be crazy. I hate going to the hospital  but I couldn't handle it any longer.

AH-mazing! I used $T$ as a little girl for a muffler burn (2nd and 3rd degree). It healed without even leaving a scar. I am using it now for burns suffered from falling into an outdoor propane heater; 2nd degree burns on my back and forearm. I am praying for the same amazing results! This medication is a God send.

I've had the $T$ for a little over a year now. I love it! I have tried every birth control under the sun. The pill, the patch, the ring, and I had managed to find a way to forget, mess up, or skip each one of them. $T$ has given me so much more freedom. I haven't gained any weight and any moodiness was probably something I would have experienced without all the hormones. I recommend it.
